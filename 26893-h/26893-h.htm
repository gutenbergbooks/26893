<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
</div>

<p>The reader who is willing to give the following
pages a careful reading, and a courteous hearing,
is entitled to know the basis of study, observation
or experience from which the suggestions,
inferences and conclusions proceed, in order that
he may fairly estimate their value.</p>
<p>At the age of seventy-two, my egotism is at
least softened by the discovery of the many things I
do not know; and my dogmatism, so far as it ever
existed, is equally relaxed by the realization that it
is a bar to light and knowledge, which rest so
largely on demonstration.</p>
<p>For more than forty-five years I have been engaged
in the active practice of medicine with consultations
extending over three States.</p>
<p>For an equal length of time I have lectured in
Medical Colleges, fifteen years on the subject of
Physiology, an equal number on Therapeutics (including
Pathology and Histology), and for the last
fifteen years on Psychology, Mental and Nervous
Diseases, and all this time with a large College
Clinic from the poorer classes.</p>
<p>From first to last, my &#8220;Study of Medicine&#8221;
has been generically and specifically a &#8220;Study of
Man,&#8221; physical, mental, ethical, and psychical.</p>
<p>Outside of Medicine as a &#8220;Calling&#8221; or a &#8220;Profession&#8221;
my real interest has been to unravel the
nature of man, grasp the problem of human life,
and to apprehend the nature, laws, and destiny of
the human soul. My library covers a rather continuous
thread from 1543, and the time of Paracelsus,
to Profs. James, Ladd, Lombroso, Sir
Oliver Lodge, and Münsterberg.</p>
<p>My reading dips into the Sacred Books of the
East, the records of the Past, and particularly
the psychic phenomena of different ages, finding
at last the Constructive Theorem clearer than
anywhere else in the &#8220;School of Natural Science,&#8221;
from the fact that it is demonstrably cognizant
of all preceding work, and definitely conforms to
the strict demands of Science&mdash;Physical, Mental,
Ethical, Psychical and Spiritual, and proves to be
the very thing for which I have searched for nearly
half a century.</p>
<p>The foregoing statements are not made to force
credulity nor to assume authority. They simply
mean&mdash;This is how, and where, and how long, I
have been searching, largely, also at the bedside of
the sick, the deranged and the dying; from the first
breath of the little one that comes&mdash;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>to the death-damp and the last sigh of the aged;
in one case at nearly one hundred and four years.</p>
<p>Once I found an old lady of eighty, dying. The
&#8220;death-damp&#8221; on her brow; the &#8220;death-rattle&#8221;
in her throat; the chin dropped, and no pulse at the
wrist. She had a wayward son who had been promised
due notice of any change, and he had been sent
for. Speaking distinctly in her ear <i>I called her
back</i>; the motive being the grief of her son at not
bidding each other good-bye. The response was
immediate. The &#8220;rattle&#8221; in her throat ceased.
The pulse promptly returned. The mouth closed.
Then I said&mdash;&#8220;open your eyes,&#8221; which she promptly
did with a gentle smile. &#8220;You are not going to
do it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. The son soon
came in and received his mother&#8217;s caress and
blessing. At the same hour on the following day,
she passed peacefully to the beyond, dying of old
age. Had it been a &#8220;crisis&#8221; in disease, she might
have recovered.</p>
<p>As a psychic phenomenon I never saw anything
just like it. Had I before doubted the existence
of a &#8220;separable soul,&#8221; it would have ended all
doubt. From the magnetic border of the &#8220;Great
Divide&#8221; <i>with a sufficient motive</i>, I literally &#8220;called
her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evidence of the concreteness, and wholeness
and self-awareness of the Individual Intelligence,
functioning in and through, and separable from
the physical body, was complete. No other explanation
or conclusion would fit or cover the case at all.
Had I been clairvoyant and able to <i>see</i> the entity,
it would have been another link in a chain whose
sequence pointed all one way. But even here I
was not without a witness.</p>
<p>In another case, an old lady was dying. A &#8220;Platform
Lecturer&#8221; (Mediumistic) was present and
described, incidentally, what she saw. She was a
good, clean, ignorant woman and only &#8220;controlled&#8221;
on the Platform.</p>
<p>She described a vapor emanating from the body,
as the &#8220;death-damp&#8221; increased, and outer &#8220;awareness&#8221;
failed. This vapor seemed to adhere together
until it stood near the head, rounded and nearly
reaching the ceiling. Then the &#8220;spirit form&#8221;
passed out from the top of the head, was inclosed
in the ball of &#8220;vapor,&#8221; and together they &#8220;floated
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found that she had never heard of the &#8220;Auric-egg&#8221;
nor read a page of the old Eastern philosophy,
and yet she had accurately described, step by step,
what the Masters for ages declare occurs at death.</p>
<p>Science is the careful observation, demonstration
and record of Facts, their orderly grouping or
classification, and the logical and sequential conclusions
resulting therefrom.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of opinion and belief, nor
dogma and denial, no matter how large, respectable,
and sincere may be the army of the dogmatists.</p>
<p>Take these suggestions and conclusions&mdash;my
friend&mdash;for what you think them worth, since now
you know how far they have grown from experience
and the love and search for the simple Truth.</p>
<p>The temptation to quote and annotate from many
authors is very great, but the material is so abundant
that one scarcely knows where to begin, where
to end; and as the address is solely to the reader
of &#8220;average intelligence,&#8221; and argument is eliminated
as far as possible, many quotations could do
little more than confirm opinions, and would extend
beyond the limits designed by the author, or the
brief space and popular form more desirable for
the average reader.</p>
<p>Repetitions in the text seemed unavoidable for
the reason, that at every phase of the subject I
have continually to regard the Individual, and that
aggregate called Society; the inner conscious life
of <i>one</i>, and the associate elements and conditions
regarding the many, and from different viewpoints.</p>
<p>Man, the Individual, is like a &#8220;wheel within a
wheel,&#8221; the larger circle being Humanity as a
whole.</p>
<p>Nor does the thought or concept stop here. There
is the relation of the Individual Intelligence we
call MAN to the Universal Intelligence we call
GOD, which as related to Nature is &#8220;In All,
Through All, Over All, and Above All.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not an &#8220;Absentee God,&#8221; but Illuminant within
and without revealing itself in what we call Love
and Law.</p>
<p>Here &#8220;in brief&#8221; I rest the case and proceed to the
evidence.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p>In &#8220;A Study of Man, and the Way of Health,&#8221;
first published twenty-one years ago, as a general
outline for my classes of Medical Students, to enable
them to grasp the real problem of life, and to
emphasize the Study of Man, as basic in the Study
of Medicine, the following epitome was placed in the
Preface.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;The cosmic form in which all things are created
and in which all things exist is a Universal Duality.</p>
<p>Involution and Evolution express the two-fold
process of the One Law of Development, corresponding
to the two planes of being, the Subjective
and the Objective.</p>
<p>Consciousness is the central Fact of Being.</p>
<p>Experience is the only method of knowing.</p>
<p>Therefore, to Know, is to Become.</p>
<p>The Modulus of Nature, that is, the Pattern,
after which she everywhere builds, and the <i>Method</i>
to which she continually conforms is an Ideal, or
Archetypical Man.</p>
<p>The Perfect Man is the anthropomorphic God.
A living, potential Christ in every human soul.</p>
<p>Two natures meet on the human plane, and
focalize in man.</p>
<p>These are the Animal Ego and the Higher Self.
The one, an inheritance from lower life. The other,
an overshadowing from the next higher plane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>The Animal Principle is Selfishness. The Divine
Principle is Altruism.</p>
<p>However defective in other respects human nature
may be, all human endeavor must finally be measured
by the principle of Altruism and must stand
or fall by the measure in which it inspires and uplifts
Humanity.</p>
<p>The highest tribunal is the criterion of Truth, and
the test of truth is by its use and beneficence. &#8216;BY
THEIR WORK YE MAY KNOW THEM.&#8217;</p>
<p>Superstition is not Religion; Speculation is not
Philosophy; Materialism is not Science; but true
religion, true philosophy and true science are ever
the handmaids of Truth, and will at last be found
in perfect harmony.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>After more than twenty years of continuous and
careful study since the foregoing was written, I must
still confirm and emphasize these basic propositions
to-day.</p>
<p>The attempt is herein made to apply them more
particularly to the study of Psychology. To add
to what was then discerned and designated as
&#8220;the Modulus of Nature,&#8221; an exact and comprehensive
Theorem of Psychology.</p>
<p>I am well aware how presumptuous this would
in certain quarters be considered, if there were the
least probability that &#8220;those in authority&#8221; would
read these pages at all. The motive is involved in
the modulus, and I am quite content to leave it
there, while the &#8220;common people,&#8221; it is hoped, may
find herein, as I have found in the search for more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
light, encouragement, inspiration, and hope. And
these may lead to Understanding.</p>
<p>It is the farthest possible from my thought or
wish to ignore or belittle the labors of earnest students
and writers on Psychology.</p>
<p>But there is a habit of conservatism in Physical
Science to-day, that in spirit and effect differs very
little from Dogma and Orthodoxy in Religion. It
concerns methods rather than results. It is generally
incredulous through fear of being over-credulous.
It is bound by tradition, or the records
of the past, and its dogmas are deductions from the
consensus of <i>opinions</i>, rather than &#8220;decrees in
councils&#8221; or &#8220;Infallible Popes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occasionally a Scientist, like Sir Oliver Lodge,
seems to be utterly rid of both credulity and incredulity,
and for these, Science really means&mdash;
&#8220;the Facts of Nature, demonstrated, classified, and
systematized.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for the &#8220;Common People,&#8221; the average intelligent
student, for whom Science and the pursuit
of Knowledge is not a Profession, but a desire
to know, and to understand, in order to be able to
use wisely and well, it is of far less importance
to know what others think or believe, deny or
affirm, on the subject of Psychology, than to <i>realize</i>
what are the faculties, capacities, and powers of their
own souls.</p>
<p>Knowledge for the sake of knowledge, like &#8220;Art
for Art&#8217;s sake,&#8221; is one thing, Knowledge for <i>use</i>
in daily life, and for illuminating its pathway and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
revealing the purpose and destiny of man, is something
different indeed.</p>
<p>This hunger of the individual soul for real knowledge
is perhaps the most patent &#8220;Sign of the
Times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The average intelligent individual has broken
away from the traditions of the past, and yet found
nothing to take their place. One result is empty
churches, and the race for wealth, display, position,
and power. Increased idleness begets dissipation,
Paresis and Insanity increase, while wasted opportunity
both shortens and embitters life.</p>
<p>A very large number of intelligent men and
women realizing all this, and repelled by the almost
contemptuous conservatism of so-called Science,
swing to the side of credulity, and are robbed and exploited
by charlatans. They believe the Truth
<i>ought</i> to be forthcoming, and their intuitions and
demands, though oft leading to sore disappointment,
deserve a better fate.</p>
<p>It is for these, and for these reasons, that these
pages are written, and with no other hope of fame
or reward.</p>
<p>The demand is everywhere for Knowledge of the
soul. Facts there are in abundance, but how far
these facts are <i>demonstrated</i>, so as to constitute a
basis of exact science, and how to classify and
systematize them, the average intelligence does not
know.</p>
<p>The Psychical Scientist claims to know, and undoubtedly
does know, but he busies himself almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
exclusively in gathering and verifying <i>more facts</i>.
When asked by the average intelligence, &#8220;What
does it all mean?&#8221;&mdash;the answer is, &#8220;Ah! there&#8217;s
the rub. <i>Wait!</i> Some day we <i>may</i> know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The simple fact is that the Scientist is bewildered,
while the theologian and the dogmatist appeal to
Faith without Knowledge, and invoke miracle as
in all past times.</p>
<p>Spiritualism has had its day and left an immense
body of facts, while Mediumship and the dark
circle are more often repudiated by intelligent
professed Spiritualists. Satisfied as to conscious
existence after death as a <i>fact</i>, they have learned
how generally unreliable are many messages from
departed friends, owing to conditions beyond their
control; while the effect of surrender to so-called
&#8220;spirit-control&#8221; contributes to neither health nor
a well-balanced mind or character.</p>
<p>Hypnotism maintains a precarious hold, simply
through juggling with the words, &#8220;Suggestion&#8221;
and &#8220;Hypnosis.&#8221; The professional hypnotist, yielding
as he must to the public fear and condemnation
of Hypnotism, advocates <i>Just a little of it!</i> under
the false title &#8220;Suggestion,&#8221; for the good it is
claimed to do in such cases as the drink and drug
habit. As though a little further <i>weakening of the
will</i>, would ultimately tend to restore and strengthen
it!</p>
<p>One is reminded of the baby in &#8220;Pendennis.&#8221;
The Mother &#8220;hoped the Lord would forgive her,
because it was such a little one!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>Even the leaders in the &#8220;Emmanuel Movement&#8221;
have deceived themselves by this sophistry, and
while they applaud the temporary results, they
seem unaware that they are still further weakening
self-control and real character, by dominating the
Will.</p>
<p>It is thus that ignorance, confusion and unrest,
like waves of ocean, ebb and flow in the great
human tides.</p>
<p>Through impatience and discouragement alone,
many give up the quest for knowledge as hopeless,
and while too well-balanced to drift into dissipation,
they suffer from <i>ennui</i> and become pessimistic.</p>
<p>Real knowledge will not come all at once, like a
vision, or a complete revelation.</p>
<p>The first real Light that comes will be that of
Faith, a term generally misunderstood and misused.</p>
<p>Faith is the complete antithesis of blind dogma
and superstition. It is born within the soul, and
never imposed by outward authority enforced by
fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith is the soul&#8217;s <i>intuitive conviction</i> of that
which both reason and conscience approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>To give intellectual assent to belief in God is one
thing; to be able to declare with light and warmth
that uplifts and inspires, &#8220;<i>I know</i> that my Redeemer
liveth&#8221; is another thing entirely.</p>
<p>The impatience above referred to would see the
end from the beginning, and know all about the
development and destiny of the soul before it has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
learned the first lesson that guides and determines
both.</p>
<p>When, however, Science and Religion clasp
hands, and the facts of nature guided by the light
of Faith, build character and guide progress, there
is revealed a Philosophy of Life that needs little
revision. It is like the compass that points continually
to the pole, and gives unqualified assurance
as to the <i>direction</i> we are going.</p>
<p>So also every step in the past enables us to get
our bearings and verify our course by checking
backward.</p>
<p>Faith is no longer a blind dogma, but a compass
in the box of experience, the wise mariner&#8217;s guide
in the voyage of life.</p>
<p>If neither Science, Religion nor Philosophy, nor
all together can thus come to the service of man, can
not do it <i>now</i>, after all the weary centuries since
Plato and Aristotle, we may as well write <i>qui bono</i>
on our banners and trail them in the dust!</p>
<p>Even the theologies of the day, recognizing the
dilemma and the difficulties, still cling to the
miraculous, and to make the best of a bad bargain,
offer dogma in the place of demonstration, and contradictory
and blind belief in place of the light of
Faith.</p>
<p>While they count thousands as nominally in their
communion, the intelligent among all these have
many &#8220;mental reservations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intelligent thought of the world flows past
and beyond them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>The &#8220;Soul&#8217;s intuitive conviction&#8221; agreeing with
&#8220;both reason and conscience&#8221; holds and guides
them, in spite of the verbal &#8220;confession of faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Divinity of Jesus, the Christ, can be fully
explained under natural and divine law, without
invoking miracle.</p>
<p>The result of such explanation is to dethrone him
from the altars of dogma and superstition, and enthrone
him on the altar of Love in the heart of
Humanity.</p>
<p>This is long delayed, but cannot be defeated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF FACULTIES, CAPACITIES, AND POWERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Starting with the <i>Modulus of Nature</i>&mdash;an
Ideal or <i>Archetypal Man</i>, and coming down to
practical things in daily life&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Man <i>is</i> an <i>Individual Intelligence</i>. This is
taken as an empirical <i>fact</i>, patent to every intelligent
individual.</p>
<p>The source and nature of intelligence itself need
not here concern us. We may call it an <i>ultimate</i>
that all the philosophies of the world have signally
failed to explain. It is something that grows, increases
or decreases, expands, becomes confused,
according to the conditions of bodily organ and
function, heredity, environment, personal effort and
the like; but so far as we know, it is the same
thing, large or small, wise or foolish. It is still,
measure for measure, Individual Intelligence.</p>
<p>2. The term <i>Individual</i> means distinct, concrete,
relatively separate. Man being an Individual Intelligence;
God is the Universal Intelligence. Just
as the organism of man is involved in, and evolved
from Universal Nature; so the Intelligence of
man is involved in, and evolved from Universal
Intelligence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>The empirical fact of the intelligence of man
presupposes a &#8220;sufficient reason&#8221; or source. Still
we do not know what God and Nature and Intelligence
are. We only know <i>how they manifest</i>. Our
intelligence enables us to observe, reflect, reason,
and in some measure apprehend the <i>method</i> and
<i>manifestation</i>.</p>
<p>I am not seeking to build nor unfold a &#8220;Philosophy.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; someone replies, &#8220;but a philosophy
is implied or involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very well, let <i>it</i> unfold <i>itself</i>.</p>
<p>3. The next empirical fact of prime importance
is, The Individual Intelligence, not of man, but
which <i>is</i> man, is <i>aware of itself</i>, i.e., &#8220;self-conscious.&#8221;
It is able to distinguish between the self and the
non-self.</p>
<p>4. Again, as to <i>consciousness</i>, as with intelligence:
We know that man has it and uses it, and
what it <i>does</i> to some extent; but we do not know
what it <i>is</i>, intrinsically, nor do we need to know
any of these <i>ultimates</i>. The effort to explain them
has never ended in anything but confusion. We
shall herein name them, and then pass them.</p>
<p>5. We have now postulated a self-conscious,
Individual Intelligence, as the real man. Next we
find this Man can <i>do</i> things, or <i>refrain</i> from doing;
act, or refrain from action. This is called Initiative,
Volition, Will.</p>
<p>6. This power of action and of choice, inspired
by intelligence, aware of the self, adapts actions to
ends. This involves reason and judgment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>7. In the course of experience along the lines of
action or restraint, and observing results in either
case, the individual desiring or preferring certain
results to others, acquires more or less self-control.
He controls himself to secure desired results.</p>
<p>Here then, in brief outline, are the basis and the
elements of our Psychology. They are drawn from
common observation and experience, and are verified
by the facts of daily life&mdash;generally complicated,
confused, or lost sight of in treatises on psychology.</p>
<p>Two of these factors, viz.: Consciousness and Will,
enter into all psychological phenomena such as
Hypnotism and Mediumship, and into every form
of mental alienation, insanity, obsession and the like.</p>
<p>Moreover, by building out of mental phenomena
a distinct entity&mdash;largely independent of the self-conscious
Intelligence, and almost equally so with
consciousness&mdash;our &#8220;philosophies,&#8221; &#8220;metaphysics,&#8221;
and explanations have become as confused and unreliable
as the psychical phenomenon itself.</p>
<p>Hudson&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Law of Psychic Phenomena,&#8221;
&#8220;Subliminal&#8221; and &#8220;Supraliminal Consciousness,&#8221;
and the juggling with the terms &#8220;suggestion&#8221; and
&#8220;hypnosis&#8221; may serve as sufficient illustrations. In
each instance phenomena are made to take the place
of principles and the core of the problem is ignored,
confused, or lost sight of.</p>
<p>In the meantime these empiricists are hunting in
the &#8220;rubbish of the temple&#8221; (which temple they
have <i>metaphysically</i> destroyed), for the Human
Soul&mdash;i.e. the concrete, intrinsic Individual Intelligence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
which is ONE, and which the Master Builder
(Universal Intelligence) placed on the Trestle-board
of Creation and Time, for the building of character,
and the evolution of the Human Soul.</p>
<p>If the Ideal, Archetypal, or Divine Man, is
recognized as the <i>Modulus</i> of both Nature and
Divinity, our Theorem must consist in adhering to
the Modulus and working out the problem.</p>
<p>Q. E. D., if applied to man&#8217;s completion of his
own individual Temple, might stand for the last
words of Jesus, &#8220;It is finished,&#8221; The problem is
solved; &#8220;I have finished the Work Thou gavest me
to do.&#8221; Science, Religion and Philosophy have
clasped hands. Divinity revealed in Humanity is
triumphant over Death. &#8220;There is a Natural
(physical) body and there is a Spiritual body,&#8221; and
the Individual Intelligence is ONE in each, or in
both; viz.: The Human-Divine Soul.</p>
<p>To recognize the <i>Modulus</i> and intelligently to
apprehend the <i>Theorem</i> is the foundation and the
first step in the scientific solution of the problem of
life, and the progressive and continuous evolution of
the human soul. To use the term &#8220;Science&#8221; (as
applied to the study of psychology) in any other
way, is pure empiricism, is wholly unscientific, and
has never yet resulted in anything but confusion and
in laying a foundation for belief, conjecture, theory,
dogma, superstition, and fear.</p>
<p>The step of next importance, both in the scientific
study of psychology and in individual progress and
evolution, is the mental attitude of the individual;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
his point of view; his open-mindedness and utter refusal
to <i>pre</i>judge anything. He will often say, &#8220;I
do not know.&#8221; He will sometimes say, &#8220;I do not
care.&#8221; That phase or presentation does not appeal
to, nor interest him.</p>
<p>This is what the Vedic philosophers called, &#8220;making
the mind <i>one pointed</i>&#8221; and like a search-light, with
the ability to concentrate it on a given point or
subject.</p>
<p>Bias, prejudice, preconceived opinion, credulity and
incredulity, are all like a crooked lens to the
eye of the mind, or to the perception of the simple
truth.</p>
<p>Not only are these principles basic in the scientific
study of psychology and the evolution of the individual
intelligence, but their neglect and oversight
are solely responsible for the confusion everywhere
manifest on the subject, as well as for <i>every form of
subjective control</i>, mediumship, psychical epidemics,
and obsession, and they enter into every form and
phase of insanity.</p>
<p>If this be true, and it is readily demonstrable, what
subject is of equal importance; and what facts and
considerations are so transcendent as these?</p>
<p>The difference is that between a mad-house with its
frenzied and frightened mob of helpless victims, and
a palace of the gods in which dwelleth Righteousness,
Love, Peace, and Eternal Joy.</p>
<p>Is it not <i>worth while</i>?</p>
<p>This Modulus and Theorem of the School of
Natural Science involve Religion, Regeneration,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Redemption, and the well-being of Souls here and
hereafter.</p>
<p>They separate Religion from Superstition, Duty
from Dogma, cast out Fear, release the wings of
aspiration and faith; and where &#8220;the mourners went
about the streets&#8221; is heard a new song of rejoicing
that binds up the wounds and sorrows of the brokenhearted.</p>
<p>Again I ask, &#8220;Is it not worth while?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>EMPIRICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Let us bear in mind that man <i>is</i> an Individual
Intelligence; that this involves self-consciousness,
or awareness of Self, the innate ability to
distinguish between the Self and the non-Self.
Hence arises the power of choice, discernment, or
discrimination.</p>
<p>There also arises the impulse to <i>act</i>, or the Initiative,
called the Will. This also involves the
power of restraint, the act or the refraining from
action.</p>
<p>This action, under the basic endowment&mdash;intelligence&mdash;is
called <i>Rational Volition</i>.</p>
<p>There is thus, Intelligence; the Power to choose;
the power to act and the adaptation of acts or
restraints to ends, or to desired objects or results.</p>
<p>Experience teaches the individual, thus endowed,
that he is responsible for all he thinks, feels, acts
and does; and this, under his endowment of Intelligence,
is what we call <i>Conscience</i>.</p>
<p>We are not building up a theory, but simply
analyzing psychological facts, demonstrated as true
in the experience of every intelligent individual.
Just as the chemist analyzes a compound he finds in
his laboratory.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>Our <i>Modulus</i> is the Perfect Man. Our <i>Theorem</i>
is the method of use that, by experience and observation
everywhere, has been demonstrated as Constructive,
enabling the Individual to build toward,
and to realize the Modulus.</p>
<p>The power to discriminate, choose and act, when
normally exercised, implies judgment and understanding.</p>
<p>Hence, we have perception, rational choice, intelligent
action and desired results, for which we recognize
our personal responsibility. Hence arise our
ability and necessity to <i>review</i> our actions, motives,
aims and their results, and to pass judgment upon
them in the Light of Conscience (Con-Science, to
know the Self) to pass judgment upon ourselves
as to motives, aims, results, and consequences.</p>
<p>The Brain is a center of consciousness with avenues
of perception and impulse and departments
that by aggregation, separation or association, enable
the Individual Intelligence to determine the
relation in time, or duration, force and orderly
relation of perceptions, desires, motives, actions (or
thoughts and feelings) as to sequence or results.</p>
<p>This whole conscious realm is the Mind. It is
the <i>inner chamber</i> of the <i>Soul</i>. It is in no sense
an entity. The actor, the real entity, is the Individual
Intelligence.</p>
<p>To say, therefore, that &#8220;Man is all mind,&#8221; or
that the mind does this, or that, is simply nonsense.
It is like saying that the little room in which I am
now writing, with its books and pictures, with my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
thoughts, feelings, emotions, and magnetism, is <i>I</i>!
Perhaps it is <i>like</i> me, or <i>full</i> of me, but <i>I</i> am something
<i>else</i> and something <i>more</i>.</p>
<p>Let us get rid of this &#8220;confusion of tongues&#8221;;
this &#8220;babel of Psychology&#8221;; &#8220;New Thought&#8221; (as
old as man); &#8220;Metaphysics&#8221;; &#8220;Christian Science&#8221;
<i>et hoc genus omne</i>, and come down to common sense
and the facts of nature. The aim and the results
along these lines are often good and helpful; then
why clothe them in the garb of absurdities?</p>
<p>Recognize the facts, and express them intelligently,
and they may do ten times more good, for
then we could understand them. They are, one and
all, a weak dilution of the old Hindoo Yoga,
thrashed over there for thousands of years; straining
after <i>results</i>, while ignorant of, or ignoring
<i>basic principles</i>.</p>
<p>Aside from the &#8220;Eight Systems of Philosophy&#8221;
now recognized in India, there are hundreds of
varieties and classes of <i>Yogis</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;To acquire powers&#8221; is one thing; self-mastery
and self-knowledge are quite another. Thus the
one is often distorted and always transient; the
other constructive, regenerative, and enduring.</p>
<p>To illustrate by contrast what Constructive Psychology,
or the building of character, <i>is not</i>, we may
now take some of the forms of diseased action
known to all time, occurring in individuals and in
epidemics, and which to-day fill our Insane Asylums
with &#8220;Incurables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The point of first importance in all these cases,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
is the <i>lack</i> of self-control. Weakness, aberration
or disease of the Will. The Individual Intelligence
fails to exercise its divine prerogative and be
<i>Master</i> in and of its <i>own house</i>.</p>
<p>In the place of this control, sensations, feelings,
emotions, desires, appetites, passions, and ambitions
run riot. The <i>Servants</i> of the Master war among
themselves, quarrel with each other, bind the Master
hand and foot, wreck the furniture, and at last
destroy the house. The Master has become the victim
and at last the slave of his own servants. His
Will is in abeyance; his perceptions distorted; his
feelings and emotions aggravated; his &#8220;Reason
Dethroned&#8221;; his judgment impaired; he has an
&#8220;Unbalanced Mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is here needed but <i>Christos</i> in the Temple,
&#8220;turning over the tables of the money-changers and
the seats of them that sold doves,&#8221; and restoring the
High-Priest in the Holy Temple&mdash;the Human
Soul, viz.: the intelligent Will of Man, determined
to govern his own house, and responsible for results?</p>
<p>In place of Rational Volition, clear, just and
true perceptions, sound judgment and clear understanding,
we have &#8220;Illusions,&#8221; &#8220;Hallucinations&#8221;
and &#8220;Delusions.&#8221; In other words, the Individual
is <i>Insane</i>!</p>
<p>It all goes deeper than the <i>Mind</i>; the Soul, the
Individual Intelligence is dethroned in his own
Kingdom; Body, Mind, and Soul are out of joint.</p>
<p>Not only does this condition exist without being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
recognized; not only just here lies the whole secret
and field of <i>Education</i> in child, woman and man,
but so ignorant are thousands as to these patent facts
and basic principles, that they covet and strive
after this confusion, this devolution, in the vain
search for knowledge, light, and truth.</p>
<p>These are the office, the function and the result
to the subject (or victim) of Mediumship and
Hypnotism. They yield the Will, the mastery of
their own house, to another.</p>
<p>The servants may be tractable for a while, but
an <i>alien</i> is seated upon the throne, and the Master
is no longer King in his own realm.</p>
<p>Others may indeed learn something from his
undoing, from the crimes committed upon him, just
as we learn from criminals how we <i>ought not</i> to
live.</p>
<p>Whether ignorantly, voluntarily, by persuasion,
or by force of a stronger will, the medium and the
hypnotic subject are victims either of ignorance
or of design, to their own undoing.</p>
<p>These psychical experiences have been found in all
ages and among every people of whom we have
any valid history, from the red Indians of the
North to the Voodoos of Africa, and from the Hill
Tribes of India to the earliest Scandinavian Tribes
and the islands of the sea.</p>
<p>As civilizations advanced, the more intelligent and
unscrupulous individuals, ambitious of knowledge or
power, regardless of the rights or well-being of
others, and discovering these powers, exercised them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
for their own aggrandizement. This has been
known through the ages as <i>Black Magic</i>, and is
laughed at to-day by so-called &#8220;Scientists&#8221; as
&#8220;nothing but the fears, credulity, and superstitions
of the ignorant multitude.&#8221; This was the core of
Egyptian Paganism, and is the very genius of
Clericalism to-day&mdash;the domination of the Individual
Will, through superstition and fear.</p>
<p>Owing to seismic and cataclysmic shocks, volcanic
eruptions, tidal waves, and great epidemics of disease,
whole peoples have been dominated by fear
or frenzied by superstitious dread, so that whole
villages and cities became literally &#8220;mad-houses,&#8221;
and were often depopulated.</p>
<p>Read the story of &#8220;Peter, the Hermit,&#8221; and &#8220;The
Crusades,&#8221; the &#8220;Black Death,&#8221; the &#8220;Great
Plague&#8221; that swept over Europe in the Thirteenth
century; or that of the &#8220;Flagellants,&#8221; and the
&#8220;Dancing Mania,&#8221; where whole villages became
&#8220;Dancing Dervishes,&#8221; samples of which may occasionally
be found to-day in the cities of America,
the &#8220;Yogis&#8221; that are &#8220;Buddhas&#8221; or &#8220;Christs&#8221; in
New York, and the Dowies that were &#8220;Elijahs&#8221;
in Chicago, the Genius of Point Loma, Obispo,
Santa Rosa, &#8220;Oahspe,&#8221; &#8220;Solar-Biology,&#8221; and
again, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>! Verily! &#8220;there is nothing
new under the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrast these individuals with an individual of
sound mind, good judgment, and a well-ordered
life, and see how and where and why the wreck
inevitably follows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>The pressure outside changes continually, and
these things spread and grow like all contagions.
Nature at times seems wrathful and destructive, and
there are, no doubt, deep-seated conditions and
changes in the magnetism of the earth and air, not
yet comprehended by modern science.</p>
<p>In stamping out contagious and epidemic disease,
simple cleanliness has been like a revelation from the
gods, and modern surgery has only stopped short
of the miraculous.</p>
<p>Society is but the aggregation of individuals, and
on the one principle of <i>Self-Control</i> every individual
is related to the negative or the positive side of
psychical and physical epidemics.</p>
<p>There is scarcely an avenue along these lines that
has not been more or less explored by modern
science.</p>
<p>That knowledge is still incomplete; that mistakes
have been made; that matters have been contemptuously
set aside, belittled, or declared to be
not worth investigation, was to have been expected.
But the progress has been immense, and the light
shines on many obscure and difficult problems, where
before was the utter darkness of superstition and
fear, dirt, degradation, and death.</p>
<p>These phenomena manifest on the physical plane,
disturb the social state, and the relations of individuals
to each other. They concern the environment
of man in a world of matter, sense, and
time.</p>
<p>But the Individual Intelligence, which is Man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
lives also in another world, related to, but within,
around, and beyond the physical.</p>
<p>Man senses or feels it as anterior to birth and
extending beyond death. He calls it the subjective
or Spiritual World.</p>
<p>The realm of his consciousness is related to it,
as the body is related to the physical plane and
the things of sense and time. His consciousness
seems <i>aware</i> of both planes or both worlds, though
ignorant of the real nature and meaning of both,
and capable of interpreting neither correctly.</p>
<p>Man feels his way through the life on the outer
plane guided by his experience of weight, measure,
distance, resistance, and the like.</p>
<p>The other world&mdash;the inner, or subjective&mdash;seems
distant, evasive, and unreal, and in contemplating
it he is filled with uncertainty, dread, fear, and
superstition.</p>
<p>Our friends die and disappear; we miss them,
and mourn for them. Where are they? What
will become of us when we die? Shall we ever
meet them again?</p>
<p>Passing by religion and revelation, as we are
dealing with facts and phenomena in the natural
life of man, rather than with creeds and dogmas that
undertake to cut the &#8220;Gordian Knot,&#8221; these questions
stare everyone in the face, and in every age
man has tried to solve them by actual knowledge.</p>
<p>Belief in ghosts, angels and demons is practically
universal; and just here comes in the whole range
of psychical phenomena, facts and fantasies, illusions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
hallucinations and delusions, rational volition,
reason dethroned, and the Will in Subjection, already
referred to.</p>
<p>As individual experiences, subjective or objective,
all are real. The fear incited by illusions and
hallucination, or by &#8220;seeing a ghost,&#8221; regardless
of the fact of its actual existence, is as real to the
individual as that of meeting a serpent in the grass,
or a tiger in the jungle.</p>
<p>Soothsayers, diviners, prophets, mediums, conjurers,
and seers consequently have been found in
every age and among every people. Ignorance,
fear, dread of death, desire to know, have always
provided them with patrons, followers, or disciples.</p>
<p>They have often reaped a rich harvest, and not
unfrequently dominated a race or a people, as the
Papacy does to-day.</p>
<p>Where they have failed to create belief, they
have often triumphed through fear and anathema,
and often supplemented these weapons by persecution,
imprisonment, torture, and death, and so held
sway.</p>
<p>Revelation begs the question; dogma forces the
conclusion; and both dominate the soul without
convincing and without <i>knowledge</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>MEDIUMSHIP, SEERSHIP, AND HYPNOSIS</h3>
</div>

<p>Into this arena of the inquiring soul of man,
came Modern Spiritualism.</p>
<p>It contained little or nothing new, as to methods,
aims, or results.</p>
<p>The Church, Protestant and Catholic alike, uttered
their warnings, called it &#8220;dealings with the devil,&#8221;
but divested of political authority and without power
to arrest or persecute, as in the past, were unable
to stay the tide. It swept the country like a
whirlwind. The average individual, desiring to
know and to get tidings from departed friends, was
unrestrained and unterrified.</p>
<p>He could not see why, if the gates were really
ajar, angels might not communicate, no less than
devils.</p>
<p>Then came the cry of &#8220;fraud,&#8221; often amply
justified, and a cloud of uncertainty and unreliability
settled over the phenomena generally. Unscrupulous
men and women seeing their opportunity, sophisticated
and exploited it, and &#8220;exposures&#8221; of these
became common.</p>
<p>But in spite of all this, there remained facts,
and groups of phenomena impossible to explain
away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>Finally, men like Crookes and Wallace took up
the subject and investigated the phenomena, not
from the emotional, expectant, or fraternal aspect,
but from the purely scientific, and rendered their
verdict, which, though frequently ignored or treated
with contempt, remains practically unaltered.</p>
<p>Thousands became convinced of the <i>fact</i> of life
beyond the grave, and at the same time of the
unreliability of many so-called &#8220;communications.&#8221;
Finally the &#8220;Society for Psychical Research&#8221; was
formed; phenomena were searchingly examined,
verified, and recorded as a basis for further research.</p>
<p>The posthumous work of F. W. H. Myers,
&#8220;Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily
Death,&#8221; added to the Society&#8217;s records and many
other publications a record of verified facts in
psychic phenomena such as never before existed,
and which nothing short of a cataclysm can destroy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the &#8220;dark circle&#8221; went into
desuetude, and Spiritualism, as a cult, declined.
Accepting the broad conclusion of a life after death,
and with no very clear demonstration as to exactly
where, or how, the case rested largely.</p>
<p>The reason for this obscurity was to be found
in the absence of clear conceptions as to the nature
of the human soul, and what life on the spiritual
plane really signifies.</p>
<p>In other words, the foundation was laid empirically
to await classification and conclusions in a
comprehensive Philosophy of Psychology, consistent
with a science of the soul; and there it remains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
to-day with the average individual, and the average
man of physical or psychical science.</p>
<p>Returning now from this brief excursion into the
social status, to the problem as related to the mental,
moral, and physical health of individuals, and bearing
in mind our Modulus of Man, and Theorem of
Constructive Psychology, we find the annals of
Spiritualism, Mediumship, or subjective control,
of exceeding importance.</p>
<p>Another plane of life exists. Individuals on
either plane communicate with the controlling entity
on the supra-physical plane.</p>
<p>The Medium is invariably subjective and controlled.
He has no choice of controls, and often no
knowledge (never reliable knowledge) as to who
or what controls him. He is sometimes informed
by his &#8220;guide&#8221; as to the control&#8217;s identity, and
learns, often, that he and his circle have been
deceived by ignorant or &#8220;lying spirits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole process reverses our Modulus and
Theorem of Constructive Psychology, the building
of character and normal evolution.</p>
<p>The most important consideration at this point
is its relation to the sanity of individuals.</p>
<p>There are thousands of individuals to-day, who,
failing in rational volition, or self-control, are controlled
by entities on the subjective plane. They
are <i>obsessed</i>.</p>
<p>This subjective control without the knowledge or
consent of the victim, and unrecognized and generally
called &#8220;absurd&#8221; by &#8220;Alienists&#8221; and &#8220;experts,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
constitutes a very large per cent, of the
insane to-day, and because ignored or unrecognized,
these cases are classed as &#8220;Incurable.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the annals of
Spiritualism, and the records of scientific Psychical
Research, have <i>demonstrated</i> the possibility and the
<i>fact</i> of such control. It should also be remembered
that the average &#8220;expert alienist&#8221; is guided solely
by results of such obsession, where it occurs; that
he is blind to causes, liable to exclude or taboo obsession,
and therefore largely liable to err.</p>
<p>In other words, he is prejudiced; and his bias
and incredulity blind him to the facts and to the
real causes.</p>
<p>He could hardly be expected to make the obsession
<i>let go</i>, while denying that it exists. But he
<i>might</i> help the victim gain <i>Self-control</i> if he but
recognized the facts and knew how.</p>
<p>Realizing the fact of the connection of the two
worlds, the physical and the spiritual, and communication
between them in the subjective or irresponsible
way, the question naturally arises, &#8220;Is
there not another way of communication? May not
the Individual Intelligence on the physical plane
communicate with the denizens of the spiritual
plane <i>at his own volition, independently</i>? May he
not learn to see and hear them without attempting, or
desiring to <i>control</i> them, more than he does his
associates, his friends and neighbors on the physical
plane, or allowing them to control him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it not purely a question of <i>fact</i>, and of scientific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
demonstration, to be determined by experiment?</p>
<p>This question leads us to another phase of psychology
and the records of the past. There have
been Seers, Clairvoyants, and Clairaudiants in all
ages.</p>
<p>Unlike the psychical phenomena already referred
to,&mdash;and belonging to the positive and initiative,
rather than the negative and subjective side of
the psychical equation,&mdash;these seers have been fewer
in number, and are always individuals showing a
high degree of self-control, and of intellectual and
moral evolution.</p>
<p>Admitting the general propositions involved, it
can readily be seen that this must be so from the
very nature of the case. The Masters of mankind,
in any and all directions have been few. The
slaves, through ignorance, superstition and fear,
have been legions. Those who have gained habitual
self-control, and finally self-mastery, knowledge
and power, have been few; while the majority have
been controlled by their own appetites and passions,
and by other individuals.</p>
<p>This self-mastery and higher evolution also includes
another element beside strength of character,
and that is, Refinement.</p>
<p>In other words; it is, from first to last, a journey
from the gross and sensuous physical plane, toward
the refined and spiritual plane, involving all the
faculties, capacities, and powers, feelings, sensations,
emotions, intuitions, and aspirations of man. It
is, in short, a normal, higher evolution.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>All the elements of this higher evolution are basic
and innate in the original endowment of man. By
exercise, the latent faculties, capacities and powers
grow, expand, and develop. Self-control, rational
volition, and the sense of personal responsibility,
(conscience) make the evolution conformatory to the
Modulus&mdash;the Perfect Man.</p>
<p>As this human being, dwelling on the physical
plane, <i>e</i>volves, the spiritual faculties of the Divine
Man are <i>in</i>volved from the spiritual plane. When
this simultaneous and co-ordinate development is
complete, the Human and the Divine are <i>at-one</i>
in the Individual.</p>
<p>This at-one-ment is the exact opposite of &#8220;vicarious.&#8221;
It is the result of personal effort and self-mastery.</p>
<p>The dogma of the church has so completely sophisticated
it as to turn normal evolution into
<i>devolution</i>; and, so far as it has any effect, or is
operative at all, to turn man backward toward the
animal, instead of upward toward the Divine.</p>
<p>Seership and Spiritual powers, therefore, as the
result of &#8220;Living the Life,&#8221; are <i>Evolutionary</i>.
Mediumship, subjective control, and obsession in
any form, or in whatsoever degree, are <i>Devolutionary</i>.</p>
<p>Progress along either line may be very slow, but
the trend is as opposite as is the East from the
West, as Light from Darkness, as Good from Evil.</p>
<p>By classifying these powers of man and psychical
phenomena to which they give rise, whether in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
conscious, inner realm, in functions of the bodily
organism, or observable to others, we are able to
assign each to its proper class with considerable
accuracy.</p>
<p>Both evolutionary and devolutionary progress,
with the ordinary individual, are slow processes.
Seldom is either process a designed and straightforward
climbing, or a quick descent &#8220;into the dark
abyss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consequently, as the human race evolves as a whole,
relatively more and more individuals are found who
&#8220;get flashes&#8221; of sight or sound, more or less from
the subjective or spiritual plane of being. There
are intuitions, &#8220;warnings,&#8221; and premonitions of
coming events. Some seek and cultivate, others
fear and avoid them.</p>
<p>They are mostly on the &#8220;border-land,&#8221; if not on
the &#8220;ragged-edge&#8221; of insanity. It is only necessary
to further weaken the will, or to indulge the passions
and emotions, in order to decide the matter,
derange the mind, and send the individual to an
asylum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with individuals who lead a
clean, cheerful, well-ordered life, these experiences
may mean encouragement, confirmation, and progress
toward the spiritual realm of being. They
should be observed carefully, but not <i>cultivated</i>.
They may serve as guide-posts and as mere incidents
of a day&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p>The average popular cult to-day, as often in the
past, where psychical phenomena are involved, results
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
in converting the normal mental realm, the
realm of normal self-consciousness, into a vaudeville
performance; a mere &#8220;Variety Show,&#8221; where
all due sense of proportion and relation is lost.</p>
<p>In place of the normal Individual Intelligence,
sitting serenely on the throne of life and ruling his
Kingdom with justice, wisdom and paternal love,
the king joins the melee of acrobats and dancing
girls, encourages the orchestra till, in a pandemonium
of revelry, he puts out the lights, or in wild
frenzy fires the building.</p>
<p>Sometimes it claims to &#8220;command success&#8221; by
<i>demanding</i> it; or wealth without earning it; or
health without regard to hygienic law; or by &#8220;taking
a Mantram&#8221; to open the gates of heaven. Or
again, by servile obedience to the freaks or dogmas
of a &#8220;Leader&#8221; or &#8220;Official Head&#8221; and adulation
<i>ad nauseam</i>, to gain admission to the &#8220;Elect.&#8221;</p>
<p>One and all of these, from first to last, tend
toward Devolution. They are destructive, not constructive,
in building character and true manhood
and womanhood.</p>
<p>Again, the Monk or the devotee abandons society,
becomes a recluse, flees into the desert or the
mountain, subsists upon roots or herbs, sits in one
posture till the joints of the body become fixed,
holds the arms above the head till they become immovable,
and the finger nails <i>turn and grow through
the palms of the hands</i>; or sits gazing at the navel
and repeating the word <i>Om</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would seem that the ways and means
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to stop normal growth, constructive evolution and
healthy living, had been well-nigh exhausted.</p>
<p>The enthusiast, the fanatic and the &#8220;easy mark&#8221;
of to-day are seldom aware of any of these things,
and so they are bled, fleeced, and exploited accordingly.
&#8220;All is Mind!&#8221; &#8220;Great is Elijah!&#8221; or
&#8220;Mrs.&#8221; Elijah, and Oahspe is his Prophet! while
Babel reigns in the place of Natural Science.</p>
<p>The Theosophical Movement inaugurated in
this country by H. P. Blavatsky in 1875, differed
essentially and radically from all others; first, in
placing ethics as the first stone in the foundation of
a real knowledge of the nature of man. Its objects
as concisely stated at the time were&mdash;</p>
<p>First: To establish a <i>nucleus</i> for a Universal
Brotherhood of Man.</p>
<p>Second: To study ancient religions, philosophies
and sciences, and determine their relations and
values.</p>
<p>Third: To investigate the Psychical Powers latent
in Man.</p>
<p>Hospitality to Truth from any source and under
any name, was characteristic of the movement during
the entire lifetime of the Founders.</p>
<p>Dogma was eliminated, Authority beyond facts
and demonstrated truth denied, and Superstition
regarded as only another name for ignorance.</p>
<p>While the facts and the demonstrations of
Science were recognized, and given the largest hospitality,
nevertheless, the &#8220;Secret Doctrine&#8221; and,
in a broad sense, the whole movement was an effort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
to present to modern times, and particularly to the
Western world, the most ancient and pure philosophy
of old India, the <i>Vedanta</i> or &#8220;Wisdom-Religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>An immense work of rejuvenation has gone on
in India, particularly in the establishment and
maintenance of Schools for Girls, and in the relief
of poverty and discouragement of the teeming
millions.</p>
<p>An immense literature was created, not yet appreciated,
except by students here and there, who found
light, explanation, and encouragement in their
studies of the mysteries of Nature and of life.</p>
<p>Since the death of the founders of the Society, in
this country at least, only a few branches and
fragments of the original organization now remain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaders&#8221; and &#8220;Official Heads&#8221; often wholly
ignorant of the Philosophy, which colossal egotism
and exploitation could hardly supply, have brought
the very names &#8220;Theosophy&#8221; and &#8220;Brotherhood&#8221;
into contempt and ridicule in many sections.</p>
<p>As some of these &#8220;official heads&#8221; are still in
evidence, final results cannot now be formulated,
and need not be here considered or forecast. The
evidence is not all in.</p>
<p>Personally, I desire to record my great indebtedness
and highest appreciation of a noble life and a
magnificent work accomplished by one of the most
remarkable and unselfish women known to history,
and for the light and knowledge which she made
accessible, and which I still hold, practically unchanged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
but with the theorems of Natural Science,
in place of the postulates of Philosophy as better
fitting &#8220;the progressive intelligence&#8221; of the present
time.</p>
<p>The two lines of presentation when clearly apprehended
are not antagonistic, but supplementary.
Their aims and purpose are the same.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE MEASURE OF VALUES</h3>
</div>

<p>This is a very utilitarian age. Start almost any
subject, propose almost any scheme, adventure,
or investment, and the question is asked, &#8220;Will it
pay?&#8221; The multitude are cautious; the lower
stratum, the unsuccessful&mdash;the poor and the oppressed&mdash;are
envious and often bitter and resentful;
the successful are often reckless, dissipated, and
proud.</p>
<p>I am not writing an essay on Economics, but on
Ethics and Psychology; on the character, value, and
use of the resources <i>within</i> ourselves; our <i>real possessions</i>.
Here only may be found <i>actual values</i>.</p>
<p>I am not considering the &#8220;hereafter,&#8221; as to
&#8220;rewards and punishments&#8221;; what gods, devils,
angels, or men may do <i>to us</i>, here or hereafter; but
what we may (if we choose) do <i>for ourselves</i>.</p>
<p>This question is practical to the last degree.
Put the question, &#8220;does it pay?&#8221; and I answer:
It pays like nothing else on earth; it is the only
thing that is independent of time, place, or circumstance.</p>
<p>It concerns man&#8217;s <i>actual possessions</i>, of which
nothing in &#8220;the three worlds&#8221; can ever dispossess
him. I know of nothing so beneficent, in any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
concept of God or Nature, Providence or Destiny,
as this birthright and opportunity of man, to build
character, and <i>be</i> what he chooses to be.</p>
<p>He who knows his power, realizes his opportunity
and utilizes his resources, may build a Palace of
the Soul, in which he may dwell, literally, in a
&#8220;kingdom of heaven.&#8221; And because God is the
Architect, and Man the Contractor and Builder,
working strictly to the &#8220;plans&#8221; and the designs,
&#8220;that house shall stand.&#8221; It is founded on the
&#8220;Rock of Ages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone ever know or see a noble character
that was not built by the Individual himself, by
personal effort, by self-control, by self-denial, by
justice and kindness to others; often in the face of
Poverty; often in spite of wealth; often in the face
of sickness, pain and deformity; perhaps deaf and
dumb and blind; and yet, like Helen Keller, the
soul triumphant and glorified?</p>
<p>To-day, as I write, I went to the Crematory to
see the dissolution of a poor, twisted, deformed, and
tortured body of a woman past fifty, in which had
dwelt a soul so serene, cheerful, and patient, that
the beatitudes clustered around her, like doves in a
garden of roses. It required no stretch of the
imagination to determine what society she had
entered. &#8220;Like seeks like,&#8221; and each &#8220;goes to his
own place.&#8221; Her motive, the day-star of her life,
was the Mother-Love for an only son. In spite
of poverty and pain, she must reward him for love
and loyalty, by being bright and cheerful and by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
belittling her own discomfort to save him sorrow.</p>
<p>Her reward was the growth of the soul that has
now risen to its great reward, and dearer and
sweeter than all this to the Mother-heart, was to
see and realize the growth, the tenderness, and the
beautifying of the soul of the Son.</p>
<p>Did it pay? I can almost hear her shouting for
joy as she joins the anthem of the Invisible Choir
of Helpers that welcome her just over the border.
She prayed many times, even the last time I saw
her, before the great change, &#8220;If it be possible,
let this cup pass from me.&#8221; I could only say, &#8220;Wait
just a little longer,&#8221; with the assurance that every
shadow of darkness shall be transformed into dazzling
light, and every drop of bitterness into the
nectar of the Gods. She was almost deaf and
blind, but you should have heard the sweetness in
her voice and seen the radiance in her face. I did
not know that the end was so near.</p>
<p>To the son, the sweetest sound on earth was that
mother&#8217;s voice, but, though silent for a thousand
years, he would not recall her to one moment of
the old torture. His sorrow for <i>himself</i> is swallowed
up and glorified in his joy for her release.</p>
<p>And what is all this but a lesson in practical
psychology, the growth of the soul?</p>
<p>Does it pay? Ask that Mother; ask that Son
now. &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; How do you know
anything, except as you see, or experience it?</p>
<p>Character reveals itself. It cannot long hide itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
When the check goes to the bank the resources
are there. The Bank of God, and of
Nature, and of Compensation, and Eternal Justice,
cannot fail. Its resources are infinite.</p>
<p>Independent of time, place, or circumstance, I
said: Intrinsic, Inalienable.</p>
<p>Take another illustration almost at random. A
cultured soul, winning its way alone, and at great
disadvantage.</p>
<p>In the middle of the tenth century lived Farabi,
or Alfarabi. He did not confine himself to the
Koran, but fathomed the most useful and interesting
sciences. He visited Sifah Doulet, the Sultan of
Syria. The Sultan was surrounded by the learned
who were conversing with him on the sciences.</p>
<p>Farabi entered the salon where they were assembled
and remained standing till the Emperor
desired that he should be seated; at which the philosopher,
by a freedom rather astonishing, went and
sat on the end of the Sultan&#8217;s sofa. The Prince,
surprised at his boldness, called one of his officers
and commanded him, in a tongue not generally
known, to put out the intruder. The philosopher
heard him, and replied in the same tongue, &#8220;O
Signor! he who acts so hastily is subject to repent.&#8221;
The Prince was no less astonished by his reply than
by his manner and assurance.</p>
<p>Wishing to know more of him, he began a conference
among his philosophers, in which Farabi
disputed with so much eloquence and energy that
he reduced all the doctors to silence. Then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Sultan ordered music, and when the musicians entered,
Farabi accompanied them upon the lute with
so much delicacy as to win the admiration of all
present. He then drew out, at the Sultan&#8217;s request,
a piece of his own composition, and sang it with his
own accompaniment, and had the audience first
in laughter, and then in tears&mdash;and to complete
his Magic, changed to another piece and put them all
asleep.</p>
<p>The Sultan in vain urged Farabi to remain near
his person, and offered him a high position in his
household.</p>
<p>Voluminous writings of Farabi are preserved in
the library at Leyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tale of the Arabian Nights,&#8221; you may say,
and yet it is historic. It reveals the fact that resources,
character, and wisdom, in the end triumph
and surmount all obstacles. They are intrinsic and
permanent values.</p>
<p>They may remain unknown or unappreciated by
others, but they are none the less riches to him who
possesses them.</p>
<p>It was during this same tenth century in which
Alfarabi lived, that there existed at Baghdad a
Society composed of Mohammedans, Jews, Christians,
and Atheists, for the purpose of Philosophical
discussions and scientific investigation; and it was
doubtless under this influence that Alfarabi was
educated and enabled to cope with the philosophers
of the world. Here in Arabia was the highest culture
known at the time, in Medicine and all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Arts and Sciences, while the Ecclesiastics were
inaugurating the dark ages elsewhere, to eventually
spread over the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>Here and there have always appeared individuals
superior to their age and time; men who dug to
the foundations of knowledge, built character, accumulated
resources, and left their impress upon
all subsequent time.</p>
<p>Nor has this accumulation of real knowledge been
derived from books and schools, though these resources
have not been neglected.</p>
<p>Real culture of the Individual has always consisted
in the realization of the latent powers of
man, in bringing these to light, in learning by experience
how to use them. Hence arise self-knowledge,
self-control, and a higher evolution.</p>
<p>It is not a mere technical, intellectual acquirement,
the ability to define principles and formulate
propositions. It rather consists in testing them out
in actual experience; first by self-analysis to become
familiar with the real self, its capacities and powers,
its motives and aims in life; and having grasped and
adjusted all these, then to start consciously, deliberately,
determinedly, and intelligently, on &#8220;the
road to the South,&#8221; on the upward climb toward
the Light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possessions,&#8221; with the great majority of individuals,
mean something outward, in space and
time; what we have, and, for the time hold, rather
than what we are. The average idea of enjoyment
is something altogether superficial and transient. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
is found, or supposed to be found, in variety of
sensations, emotions and feelings; in ringing the
changes on these, till vitality fails, disillusion or
satiety supervenes, and old age or death closes the
play. Often the appetite remains, when vitality
fails, and Faust rejuvenated, would run the same
gauntlet again. The pity of it is that thousands of
these victims of either satiety or Tantalus seem
never to dream that there are other values, or anything
else, or better, in life.</p>
<p>And yet there is not one of these faculties,
capacities and powers that is useless, or, in itself,
evil or degrading. They are, one and all, resources
of the Individual Intelligence; tools for the day&#8217;s
work; materials for the building of the Temple;
whereas, they most frequently are made the motive
and the aim of life. They are means to a higher
end, and not the end itself.</p>
<p>Without the latent passions, emotions, and feelings,
man would be a mere mechanism. If all
were mind, or mere intellect, there could be neither
the creation nor the appreciation of beauty. Every
work of art would be soulless; music might amuse
the intellect by intricate chords and variations, like
a colorless kaleidoscope, but it could never touch
the heart nor elevate the soul.</p>
<p>Music and art, in the highest sense, through
consonant vibrations in us, open the doors and windows
of the soul, put us in touch and tune with
the Infinite, and <i>then</i>, the real harmony begins.
We live for the time in another world and return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
with a sigh and recover the bated breath, as though
we had seen a vision beyond words. Music is an
agent, a talisman, a means to an end. It strikes
in us chords that lie at the foundation, the combinations
that unlock the doors, and the &#8220;Imprisoned
Splendor&#8221; wings in and out like the
doves of Hesperides.</p>
<p>Blunt the passions, the feelings and the emotions
by over-indulgence, by vice and dissipation, and the
royal guests desert the banquet hall, the doors of
the soul creak on their hinges; and in place of the
&#8220;music of the spheres&#8221; you have a devil&#8217;s dance,
and the orgies of despair!</p>
<p><i>Does it pay?</i> It all depends on <i>use</i>. Here lie
the resources, the real possessions of man. Here
lies the &#8220;Parable of the Talents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the profusion, the prodigality, the
beneficence of Nature, Flowers and Fruit, Beauty
and Bloom and Fragrance everywhere. Where
there is no eye to see, no hand to pluck, Mother
Nature delights in profusion, seemingly because
she is made that way and cannot help it. And yet,
in this little Rose-garden of ours&mdash;the Human Soul
-we tramp down the flowers, plant loathsome
weeds and poisons that kill and degrade and besot
us, set up the tables of the money-changers, drive
out the doves of Hesperides, and turn the temple
into a shambles for wild beasts. &#8220;Nothing pays.&#8221;
&#8220;Let us curse God and&mdash;die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there not something after all in the <i>Measure
of Values</i>, and in the inexorable <i>Law of Use</i>?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>And who <i>constrains</i> us but <i>ourselves</i>?</p>
<p>Can God and Nature be so prodigal, noting
even the sparrows fall, and yet disregard the children
of men?</p>
<p>What our resources are we can never imagine
till we draw upon and begin to utilize them as
others have done throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The &#8220;average sinner,&#8221; seemingly to justify or
excuse his own failure, will not believe that any
have ever achieved. <i>But there they stand</i> all down
the ages! Ecclesiastics help the deception and
keep up the illusion by calling it <i>Miracle</i> or
&#8220;Special Providence,&#8221; and so prevent man from
entering his birthright, <i>to possess it</i>; and so we
sell our birthright for a mess of pottage. It is like
the dissipated, poverty-stricken spendthrift, who
shuts his eyes and refuses to believe that any, by
industry, economy, integrity and hard work have
secured a competency. And so he cries, &#8220;Come on,
boys! let&#8217;s have another drink, and then rob this
bond-holder, who has more than his share.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Measure of Values, and the Law of Use
<i>hold everywhere</i>, in every department of human
life; and the question, &#8220;Does it pay?&#8221; is practical
and scientific to the last degree, and no one can
answer but ourselves. As we answer will be the
results, and nothing but ourselves can change them.</p>
<p>We must realize that the human body, the organism
of man, with all its faculties, capacities and
powers, is but an <i>instrument</i> of the Individual Intelligence;
and that every experience in life, every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
episode in our career, is like a day&#8217;s work; perfecting
the instrument for more and better work, if
used rightly; till we advance from height to height
of being; to larger and still larger and more glorious
fields of work and experience.</p>
<p>There would seem to be no limit to this evolution,
this upward and onward journey of the human soul.
The more good work done, the larger the capacity
and the broader the field opening before us. &#8220;From
height to height the spirit walks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The primary endowment of man is Life and conscious
Intelligence, with the power to use both.</p>
<p>This would seem to be the only gratuity, and
whether we regard it as a blessing or a curse,
depends on how we regard and use them.</p>
<p>The great majority in all time, through ignorance
or recklessness, seem to have misused them.</p>
<p>Hence sickness, disease, deformity, and degradation.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful thing&mdash;this Law of Normal
Use&mdash;from which health, harmony, comfort, joy,
growth, and development result, while misuse and
abuse degrade and destroy.</p>
<p>Divinity seems to have put within the grasp of
man&#8217;s Intelligence (if he <i>chooses and wills</i>) an almost
infinite range in power, variety and application,
of that subtle and basic Principle of affinity, balance
and equilibrium, that unites the atoms in a molecule,
or a chemical substance; that law of attraction
and repulsion&mdash;the Parallelogram of Force&mdash;that
holds the planets in their orbits. Divinity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
seems to have taken man into council and offered
him, not only the Kingdom of Nature, but the
royal domain of his own soul, as a reward for
co-operation and loyal service, on condition that
he shall use wisely, intelligently, loyally, and kindly,
and not misuse or abuse.</p>
<p>Is it <i>worth while</i>? Will it <i>pay</i>?</p>
<p>Nor is this all, beneficent as it seems. The
whole journey of life on the physical plane here
below is so designed and planned as to make the
natural aging and decay of the physical body
supplement, unfold and develop the Spiritual Body,
through the right use of the faculties, capacities, and
powers of the Human Soul&mdash;the Individual Intelligence.</p>
<p>These are aspects, uses and powers of that
subtle <i>something</i> we call <i>Life</i>; that <i>Principle</i> that</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Runs through all time, extends through all extent,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Lives undivided, operates unspent.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Normal use that insures growth and development,
range and power of action, is also, from
first to last, a <i>refining</i> process; while misuse and
abuse of these powers degrade and brutalize
<i>inevitably</i>.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, as the bodily structure
and functions fail <i>under normal use</i> those of the
spiritual body open, develop and unfold. First
the seed, then the plant, then the flower and finally
the fruit &#8220;of a well-spent life.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;theory&#8221; or &#8220;guess-work&#8221; about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
it. It becomes, step by step, a matter of conscious,
intelligent, individual experience. We
know it just as we know that fire will burn or that
we are here now, living, breathing, and acting.</p>
<p>If I thrust my finger into a flame, all the philosophers
and metaphysicians of the world could
not &#8220;argue&#8221; me out of the experience of the
fact of &#8220;burn&#8221; and &#8220;pain&#8221;; nor could theologians
succeed any better by quotations from Scripture!
Man is so constituted that the <i>facts</i> of <i>experience</i>
are stubborn things; and the more open to reason
the individual the more convincing the facts of
experience. Ignorance, superstition, and fear recede
in the presence of these Lights of man&#8217;s
intelligence, as do dogma and despotism, that
seek to enslave the human soul.</p>
<p>Theologians tell us that it is exceeding dangerous
to take all this responsibility upon ourselves,
thus appealing to ignorance, superstition, and fear.</p>
<p>I would answer: I refuse to take the responsibility
of <i>disregarding</i> or <i>disobeying</i> the Law which
the Divine and Universal Intelligence has placed
at the <i>very foundation</i> of man&#8217;s being; and I am
so <i>un</i>orthodox as to imagine and believe that God
knew what he was about, even better than the
theologians, or the &#8220;Infallible&#8221; Italian who misinterprets
God, Nature, and Man.</p>
<p>To-day, as I write, &#8220;God&#8217;s Vicegerent&#8221; is instigating
and promoting a &#8220;Holy War&#8221; in Priest-ridden
Spain, over the temporal power of the
Vatican, angered to the point of murder over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
&#8220;posting of notices of places of public worship,&#8221;
other than Catholic.</p>
<p>They would rather turn the world into one
&#8220;City of the Dead,&#8221; than yield <i>one point</i> of
Freedom, Enlightenment, or Self-government to
man.</p>
<p>And men still call this <i>Religion</i>, and cast aside
the crucifix for the sword, the gun and the firebrand.
The <i>Inferno</i> has never yet been portrayed
or even outlined. Its name is Priestcraft and
Intolerance under the name of &#8220;Religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>And is this a &#8220;Study in Psychology&#8221;? Yea,
verily! Scientific Psychology is the only thing
that goes to the very bottom of it, and defines
and classifies every element, every fact in human
experience. Man cannot build a <i>home</i> on a piece
of ground where a slaughter-house disputes every
square yard of ground with the tombstones of
a graveyard. Clericalism is ever the one or the
other, and frequently both; denying to man the
right to build a <i>home</i> for himself anywhere, except
by its permission and according to its plans and
specifications, fixing the rent and the revenues for
all future time.</p>
<p>The Premier of Spain to-day is disputing this
prerogative of Rome, and the graveyard has been
thrown open. The pity, the marvel of it all is,
that the people generally do not seem to care, and
call any statement of facts &#8220;sensational&#8221; or
&#8220;panicky.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am told by some very good people that these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
references to Popery seem irrelevant, and by
others, that they mar the symmetry of my essay.</p>
<p>They are reminded that we are dealing with
real and permanent values, and with what man
may do and ought to do for himself.</p>
<p>Lying squarely across this upward pathway of
man, to be pursued by free choice and personal
effort, is the dogma of the Vicarious Atonement
and the forgiveness of sin, of which
&#8220;His Holiness&#8221; claims to hold the <i>exclusive
agency</i>.</p>
<p>Through appeal to superstition and fear this
preposterous and sacrilegious claim to-day, as in all
the past, paralyzes the will and discourages the
personal efforts of millions of men and women.
Between that blind credulity which makes personal
effort unnecessary, and the miracle and dogma
which make it seem useless, the upward and onward
march of man is hindered or annulled, notwithstanding
the fact that many men and women lead
noble lives who are yet communicants of the
Church, both Catholic and Protestant. True, they
may, with little thinking, reason and reflection
from early education and &#8220;lip-service,&#8221; give intellectual
assent to these dogmas. But the lives
they lead and the personal effort put forth prove
them &#8220;better than their creeds.&#8221; They say with
the lips, &#8220;Christ has forgiven us,&#8221; or &#8220;Jesus will
save us,&#8221; and while they are <i>saying</i> these things
they <i>go to work saving themselves</i> by &#8220;leading
the life&#8221; through personal effort and experience.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>In other words, they &#8220;save themselves&#8221; in spite
of their creeds and superstitions.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, with this exact &#8220;measure of
values,&#8221; that we are dealing; and the necessity
and value of these considerations are nowhere so
plain to-day, or so imperative, as just here, in
the face of these demoralizing dogmas and pretensions
of men, who contradict all natural law
and steal unblushingly the prerogatives of God,
as his &#8220;Vicegerent.&#8221; The marvel of it is that it
excites neither surprise nor protest, but is treated
with a smile of good-natured complacency outside
its circle of dupes.</p>
<p>He who treats it seriously, as a thing that, more
than any other, demoralizes, discourages and
paralyzes <i>millions</i>, is regarded as &#8220;sensational,&#8221;
&#8220;emotional,&#8221; or an &#8220;alarmist.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the face of all the facts, of which the daily
papers are full, and the record of the Vatican
crowded, I prefer that my own arraignment <i>shall
stand</i>. No one who knows half these facts can
dispute or gainsay them. We are making history
here to-day, as mankind has had to make it in all
the past, in the face of these &#8220;Lions in the path&#8221;
of civilization and progress.</p>
<p>If I must choose between being superficial,
ignorant and insincere, or being an &#8220;alarmist,&#8221; I
certainly and unhesitatingly choose to be an
<i>alarmist</i>! The strongest ally of Superstition to-day
is credulity, or indifference. The average man
says, &#8220;I do not <i>believe</i> there is any danger&#8221;; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
if he &#8220;spoke his heart&#8221; would add, &#8220;if there is,
I do not <i>care</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would only reply, &#8220;If you mean to be honest,
read, observe, and see.&#8221; You may wait too long.
Spain and Portugal are just awakening from the
priest-ridden lethargy of centuries, and are making
history anew. May a just God and all the angels
help and protect them.</p>
<p>The great daily newspapers of the country are
very conservative wherever Rome is concerned.
She is too powerful and her resources too well
organized and available to be disregarded.</p>
<p>It is therefore very significant that an editorial
in one of the largest and most influential of these
papers to-day gives a clear, concise, and impartial
epitome of the &#8220;<i>Row in Spain</i>,&#8221; clearly locating
its cause and animus in the Vatican, and showing
how unbearable this tyranny and exploitation had
become to a large portion of the people of Spain.</p>
<p>I refer to this here for a special purpose, which
involves and lies at the foundation of all other
issues and considerations. And that is the statement
in this editorial, that while the Church of
Rome has held practically <i>undisputed sway</i> in
Spain <i>for centuries</i>, with immense tracts of land,
houses and revenues, independent of civil authority,
with 20,000 priests, 5,000 communities with 60,000
inmates in a population of only 20,000,000 of
people&mdash;<i>Seventy per cent. of the people are entirely
uneducated.</i> With every opportunity, plenty of
time and almost boundless resources, <i>Rome has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
kept the people in ignorance, the easier to rob
them</i>; determined to <i>own</i> the land, the resources,
and the people&mdash;body and soul&mdash;as the <i>Autocrat</i>
of heaven and earth! A slavery in the name of
&#8220;Religion&#8221; found nowhere else on earth to-day.</p>
<p>So much for Spain and the Vatican to-day. For
the sequel, watch the daily papers.</p>
<p>And what has this to do with America? With
Psychology? With the Measure of Values?</p>
<p>Simply this: Is anyone so dense as to suppose
that the <i>Seventy per cent.</i> of dense ignorance in
Spain is an accident, or an oversight of the Vatican
and its servants? There lie the &#8220;policy&#8221; and the
secret of the power of Rome.</p>
<p>In America our foundations, our bulwarks, and
our hope and security of Freedom, Enlightenment,
and Progress lie in our Free Public Schools. These
Rome hates, condemns as &#8220;Godless,&#8221; and would
destroy if she could, as continually proved by the
letters and edicts of the Popes.</p>
<p>Seeing, however, that she cannot do this, and
fearful of losing her hold on her thirteen or fourteen
million of communicants in America, she
rushes the building of Parochial Schools, and
threatens her people with dire penalties who
patronize any other. Since she cannot <i>prevent</i>
education here, as in Spain, she must &#8220;educate&#8221;
<i>in her own way</i>, in order to retain her power over
the rising generation. The basis of this education
are ignorance, superstition, and fear; its crown, the
slavery of conscience and the &#8220;Dogma of Obedience.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
The brutality of Ignorance in Spain is
the sophistry of Priestcraft under the name of
&#8220;Religion,&#8221; in America.</p>
<p>The Genius of the Vatican is &#8220;Infallibility.&#8221;
It not only never errs, but it never changes. It
dons another mask, adopts another slogan, and is
now engaged in a great crusade to <i>educate</i>!</p>
<p>Constructive Psychology, the building of Individual
Character, means the <i>precise opposite</i> of
every principle, proposition, and practice of Popery.
I desire to make this plain and unmistakable.</p>
<p>Nothing on earth transcends in importance this
basic, universal, and <i>eternal antithesis</i>. It marks
and monuments, in all time, the <i>Parting of the
Ways</i> between Good and Evil; between Liberty
and Despotism; between Light and Darkness; between
Evolution and Devolution; between &#8220;Modernism&#8221;
and Paganism; between Civilization and
the Dark Ages; between the &#8220;Sermon on the
Mount&#8221;&mdash;the Beatitudes, and the <i>Spanish Roman
Vatican Inquisition</i>!</p>
<p>And this &#8220;antithesis,&#8221; this issue, is as imminent,
as active, as burning in America to-day, as it is in
Spain. It only faces different ways.</p>
<p>Spain is <i>compelled</i> to redeem her <i>past</i>; America
to guard and protect her <i>future</i>.</p>
<p>It is, from first to last, a Psychological Problem.</p>
<p>It is an analysis by fire, in the crucible of fate
and destiny, to determine <i>accurately</i> the measure
of values to the Individual, to Society, and to
Civilization.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>No man, woman or child, no society, no civilization
ever has, or ever can, escape this issue.</p>
<p>It is the design on the trestle-board of Time.</p>
<p>It is the Modulus of both God and Nature
regarding Man.</p>
<p>It is the Theorem of Psychology.</p>
<p>It involves the Evolution and Destiny of the
Human Soul.</p>
<p>As civilization in many places showed an advancing
tendency from the darkness, despotism and
brutality of the Dark Ages, the &#8220;Robber Barons&#8221;
began to disappear. Their slogan was, &#8220;He may
seize who hath the power and he may hold who
can.&#8221; Serfdom also began slowly to recede.
Popery and Priestcraft assumed the rôle of these
Barons, changed the slogan from brute force (reserving
that for emergencies) to &#8220;Divine Prerogative,&#8221;
&#8220;Infallibility&#8221; (later), and pagan mummeries
in the name of &#8220;Religion.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The result, to the common people, remained unchanged</i>
to the present day&mdash;poverty, ignorance,
and oppression.</p>
<p>Popery boasts that it never changes, never relents,
nor forgives an enemy, nor forgets an injury,
nor fails to &#8220;get even,&#8221; like any brute, whenever
she can. And this <i>Power</i> is not only the assumed
custodian of the religion of Jesus, but stands in the
place of it, as a substitute, and the world tolerates
it in the name of <i>Religion</i>!</p>
<p>As a problem in Psychology, we have been considering
the nature, use, and measure of values
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
of the resources, faculties, capacities, and powers
of man as an Individual Intelligence.</p>
<p>Facing opportunities, we have seen that there is
a Law of Use and Responsibility which cannot
be evaded.</p>
<p>Institutions and societies of men are, one and
all, from first to last, under the same law. It is
simply an aggregate, into which not a new principle
enters, nor one principle is changed. The
recognized and scientifically determined value of
man to himself, is the measure of his value to the
State.</p>
<p>The reverse proposition is equally true.</p>
<p>The value of any Institution to the individual,
or to the State, must be measured and determined
in the same way and under the same law.</p>
<p>It may thus be seen that Institutions, like
Popery, are deeply involved in this Law of Use and
Measure of Values. This is simply making use
of, and putting in practice, these basic principles.</p>
<p><i>Of what use to man</i>, measured by these scientific
standards of value, are Popery and Priestcraft?</p>
<p>I answer unhesitatingly and unqualifiedly <i>An
unmitigated Curse!</i></p>
<p>This answer is justified by all history, and is as
true and as exact to-day, up to the latest act and
message from Rome, as it was during the horrors
of the Inquisition; and there are evidence and specific
statements to show that Rome would re-establish
the &#8220;Holy Inquisition&#8221; to-day, <i>if she dared and
had the power</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>It is this power, exercised through fear, on the
basis of ignorance and superstition so instilled by
what Popery calls &#8220;Religious Education,&#8221; that
prevents the majority of fourteen millions in
America to-day, as everywhere and in all time, from
exercising their prerogative and doing their duty
as <i>Individuals</i>.</p>
<p>Is it not plain, therefore, how impossible it is to
separate the Individual and the Social status?</p>
<p>Psychology and Sociology are departments of
one Science, viz.: the Science of Man, Anthropology.
Individuals and Institutions are under one law,
one law of use, one measure of values.</p>
<p>He who ignores, evades, or belittles these plain
issues and scientific principles, can settle with the
law in his own time, though he cannot evade them
always.</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;During the last week of the year 1910, the daily papers
announced that before the beginning of 1911 <i>every Priest in the
Diocese</i> was required to take an oath to oppose and resist <i>Modernism</i>
and to <i>obey</i> in all things the dictum and dogmas of His Holiness.
As everyone knows that under the term <i>Modernism</i> is included all
progress, investigation, and civilization condemned by the Vatican,
everything that even questions the dogmas and despotism of Rome,
the meaning of this required <i>oath</i> is plain.</p>
<p>It is doubtless renewed by reason of (among others) a book,&mdash;&#8220;Letters
to His Holiness by a Modernist,&#8221; which, written seemingly by a Priest,
makes exceeding plain the meaning of Modernism and the relation
of the Vatican thereto. The book marks an epoch in the close of the
old year and the beginning of the new, and Rome has acted accordingly.
She can delay the stream of progress as she has always done,
but she cannot turn it backward. It will eventually overwhelm her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>The problem of the continued conscious life
of man after the death of the physical body,
concerns the <i>where</i> and the <i>how</i>, and does not, and
need not, concern us at all now. It is, literally, an
&#8220;after consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who and what man is, here and now, is the
real problem. Only when, or in the degree in
which, we master this problem, can we really know
anything definitely of the other.</p>
<p>The complete separation of these two problems,
and the exact definition and formulation of each,
is the first step on the road to knowledge of the
Science of the Soul.</p>
<p>For the time being, in the study of Psychology,
&#8220;other worldliness&#8221; should be absolutely abandoned.</p>
<p>Almost everyone finds it difficult to do this.
Many find it impossible.</p>
<p>The fear and uncertainty with which almost
everyone faces the inevitable, the loss of friends,
the broken lute, the empty chair, the lonely life&mdash;all
these make us cry out in anguish&mdash;<i>where</i>
and <i>how</i> and <i>when</i>, and overlook the &#8220;<i>what are
we</i>?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>So-called Religion in all time has almost hopelessly
mixed and confused these problems.</p>
<p>The various concepts and doctrines of rewards
and punishments hereafter, have put ulterior
motives in the place of actual values, weakened
the will and hindered man from doing his best.</p>
<p>A still further confusion follows, in the measure
of assets, that leads to time-serving and false values.</p>
<p>Satisfy the average individual that &#8220;death ends
all&#8221; and he will cry, &#8220;Let us eat, drink, and be
merry, for to-morrow we die,&#8221; notwithstanding the
fact that he sees others who have &#8220;gone the pace,&#8221;
realized only &#8220;dust and ashes,&#8221; declared it &#8220;all a
mistake,&#8221; and that if they had the chance they
would &#8220;do it all the other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, we are dealing with <i>actual values</i>
here and now, divested of both fear and anticipation
of the hereafter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, who ever saw an individual
die, who had led a clean, upright, kindly life, indulge
in regret or remorse, or declare life a disappointment
or a failure?</p>
<p>The first is anchored to the physical plane by
insatiate appetite and passion, or desire to reform,
which might soon be forgotten.</p>
<p>The other has found sweetness and joy in life,
in conscious growth, in doing good; and his soul
is illumined and transfigured as the body fails and
he approaches another plane, and this often independent
of any formulated religious belief.</p>
<p>It all depends on what the man is <i>within</i> himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
his intrinsic character, his <i>real self</i>; and no
matter where he goes, that character, that self,
goes with him. It <i>is</i> Himself.</p>
<p>The &#8220;change in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye,&#8221; is not in the <i>man</i> and cannot be. It is in
the plane, or sphere, or world he inhabits, or to
which he goes. It is a change of garments, of
habitat, of houses in which we live&mdash;if we live
at all.</p>
<p>This much we <i>know</i>, and should not forget or
confuse it. We know it, as we know that &#8220;twice
two are four&#8221;; that fire will burn, or that bodies,
unsupported, fall to the ground. We know it
from the fact of our own self-conscious identity.
Radically or suddenly to change that essentially is
to annihilate <i>us</i>.</p>
<p>The preacher says, &#8220;Study the Bible.&#8221; He
might say, &#8220;Study yourself!&#8221; The preacher says,
&#8220;Look to Jesus.&#8221; He might say, &#8220;Look within!&#8221;
The preacher says, &#8220;Repent and pray.&#8221; I would
say, &#8220;After an inventory of your inner possessions,
clean up the house and <i>go to work</i> to improve it in
every way.&#8221;</p>
<p>When &#8220;cleaning day&#8221; is well under way, if the
&#8220;sure-enough&#8221; preacher drops in, and you show
him the house and what you are trying your best
to do, he will just start &#8220;Old Hundred,&#8221; and will
be too happy for anything else.</p>
<p>I am not criticising the preacher, nor opposing
religion, but getting ready for it, laying the foundation
of Morals and the building of character.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
&#8220;Religion&#8221; cannot do this. <i>You</i> and <i>I</i> have to do
it, or it is never done.</p>
<p>Without this work of <i>ours</i>, religion is little
more, or else, than passing emotion or lasting
superstition, &#8220;lip service,&#8221; cant, hypocrisy, and then
cold heartless dogmatism, a measure and jingling
of words that never touch the heart, but leave the
individual ready to throw stones and light brands
of torture: a case-hardening of the affections
and the aspirations, that wraps the soul like the
bandages of the mummied Pharaohs, a mere petrifaction.</p>
<p>We know, or may know, as much actually and
scientifically of the growth of the soul as of the
growth of the body. The average individual knows
more of the soul than of the body, but his knowledge
is in confusion. It is a matter of hourly,
daily, life-long, and changing <i>experience</i>. He
knows little of physiology, except feelings, sensations,
desires, and results. How and why the
mechanism of the body works he knows not.</p>
<p>Body and soul are organically identified, intimately
associated and interwoven, and act and
react on each other. They are functionally synchronous
in all movements. The analogies between
them are numberless and easily traced.</p>
<p>The physician and physiologist does not stop
to inquire, &#8220;What <i>is</i> Life&#8221; and refuse to move till
someone gives a satisfactory answer; yet he is
dealing with Life in its numberless manifestations
in the human, organism continually.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>But this same physician is likely to debate and
deny the existence of the Soul, demanding that you
define and demonstrate it.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Individual Intelligence&#8221; is as definite,
specific, and demonstrable in Psychology as
the term &#8220;Life&#8221; in Physiology.</p>
<p>We are alive and we possess a certain degree or
measure of intelligence. These are facts in our
conscious experience.</p>
<p>We may shape or mold our lives. We may
do this according to our ideals, or we may drift with
the tides of circumstance, or of passion and caprice,
and this is what most persons do.</p>
<p>So also with that intelligence which is the guiding
light in our lives. It may illumine our pathway,
or it may flash and fitfully glare, with the shadows,
rendering our pathway obscure and uncertain,
illusory and deceitful, or dangerous and fearful.</p>
<p>The soul is in the body; and this light of intelligence
is in the soul, its center, its very essence.</p>
<p>All else in us, and round about us, is diversity and
multiplicity. This light of intelligence in us is <i>One</i>
and unchanging.</p>
<p>Our experience in life, however varied and diversified,
is co-ordinated and unified by this Intelligence
in us. It is that which puts all our experiences together
and views them through a single lens. It
stands by itself alone, and all else pays tribute
to it.</p>
<p>It is the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; and it stands for, speaks
and acts for, all else in us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>It is not alone the only <i>unity</i> in us, but it is that
which unifies all the rest, uses the &#8220;possessive case,&#8221;
and may subordinate all else in us to its Will.</p>
<p>Does it, then, do violence to common sense and
hourly experience, or is it any stretch of the imagination
to speak of this unity as an entity, and call it
the human soul?</p>
<p>If we live after the change called death, in a
spiritual world, in place of the physical we now inhabit,
and with a spiritual or refined body to correspond
with that plane of refined or etherialized substance,
the Individual Intelligence must function in
that body and on that plane as it does now in the
physical body on the physical plane.</p>
<p>Either something very like this takes place, or
we cease to exist as a self-conscious individual
intelligence. There must remain and continue
man&#8217;s self-conscious identity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this be true, the <i>real nature</i> of
this individual intelligence we call the <i>Self</i>, in the
last analysis, is likely to be as much a mystery as
ever. We may know <i>who we are</i> without knowing
<i>what it is</i>.</p>
<p>Now the composite nature of man, as we know
it, not only justifies all these analogies, but seems
to show that the modulus, the germ at least, of
the spiritual body exists now within the physical;
that it does not disintegrate when the physical body
dies, but separates and coheres more closely than
ever; and is still inhabited or possessed by the
individual intelligence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>Moreover, it has often been seen by clairvoyants
at the time of death, thus verifying the Biblical
declaration, &#8220;there is a natural (physical) body,
and there is a spiritual body.&#8221;</p>
<p>The composite structures of man&#8217;s organism
above referred to are well known. They are
called &#8220;systems.&#8221; The bony or Osseous system,
the muscular system, the circulatory system, the
lymphatic system, and the two nervous systems,
serve as illustrations of the composite nature of
man.</p>
<p>All of these &#8220;systems&#8221; more or less inter-penetrate
and diffuse each other.</p>
<p>There is also a chemico-vital, kinetic, or magnetic
body, diffused through and inter-penetrating all
the rest. This gives the contrast between the living
organism (with the flush of health upon the cheek
and the light of intelligence in the eyes), and a
corpse.</p>
<p>Death is often instantaneous, while decomposition
often waits for days.</p>
<p>There is a still further analogy regarding a
single function, like a sensory or motor impulse,
passing to or from the central brain, the organ
of consciousness. The journey is one of relays
and orderly sequences.</p>
<p>This is proven in a great variety of forms of
paresis. I cannot, as an individual intelligence,
<i>directly</i> move my hand any more than I can move a
mountain. I conceive the object or act and set the
will in motion. The impulse traverses the nerves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
is transferred to the muscle, and then, when the
circuit is complete, <i>I</i> move my hand.</p>
<p>The gap between my conscious intelligent wish
and will, and my physical hand, is very great.
One is metaphysical, the other physical. There is,
therefore, a point of correlation where the one is
converted into the other.</p>
<p>The knowledge of these facts, and of this orderly
sequence and correlation, constitutes the Science of
pathology and enables us to locate the lesion or
disease. I cannot move my hand, and the pathologist
locates the &#8220;short-circuit&#8221; in brain, or
nerve, or &#8220;terminal plate,&#8221; or muscle, as the case
may be.</p>
<p>Now it is this <i>system</i> of <i>composite systems</i> that
deserves special attention. We know that it exists
as a series of relays and refining processes. In
disease it is interrupted, or out of joint, or broken
down.</p>
<p>Health means harmony, concord, rhythm between
every part, and the power of the one individual
intelligence to use it all, to act or refrain from
action, and to hold and maintain through all, repose,
equilibrium, and self-mastery.</p>
<p>The physical body we know to be a thing of
sense and time. We know its beginning, its gestation,
its entrance and exit on this material plane.
Its secrets are all involved in the subtle relations
it bears to the soul that inhabits, unifies, and utilizes
it.</p>
<p>The Individual Intelligence, Ego, Soul, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Entity, is as patent to us in our <i>awareness of self</i>
as is the body it inhabits. It is our <i>very self</i>.
Our knowledge of it is a <i>direct personal experience</i>,
so direct, immediate, and constant that we overlook
its significance.</p>
<p>I can see no reason to imagine that a human
being, passing from the earthly plane and consciously
living on the spiritual plane and recognizing
itself as the same individual, would be any
wiser as to the exact nature and origin of the
Individual Intelligence than he is now; though his
field of vision and range of conscious experience
had so immeasurably increased and expanded.</p>
<p>If he had solved this problem of <i>ultimates</i>, he
would be at the end of his thread of life and would
compass the Infinite. He would be no longer
Man, but God.</p>
<p>So, from all these considerations, and from all
directions, we come back to human evolution, the
upward and onward journey of the human soul.</p>
<p>As man&#8217;s health, usefulness, and happiness here
depend on the perfection and utility of the physical
body he inhabits, and its maintenance in health
and harmony, have we the least reason to imagine
that the same individual, dwelling on the spiritual
plane, will not be under the same of analogous
laws and relations there, since we have assumed
the persistence and conscious identity of the soul
there as here?</p>
<p>I hold, therefore, that man possesses, now and
here, the structure of a <i>Spiritual</i> Body; and that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
&#8220;growth of the soul&#8221; and our status and relation
to the soul, and our status and relation to the life
after death on the spiritual plane, depend <i>very
largely</i> on the character and integrity of this spiritual
body, the &#8220;house we have builded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole of life, therefore, here, is what gestation
of the infant body is before birth. When the
child is born it is a separate personality, a distinct
individuality.</p>
<p>There has been woven into its organism a distinct
and synchronous correspondence with that of the
mother.</p>
<p>During gestation it has passed through every
plane of organic life, from <i>am&oelig;ba</i>, or mollusk, to
man.</p>
<p>It is thus in touch with every phase and quality
of life. It epitomizes them all, transcends them all,
and <i>may co-ordinate</i> them all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the individual intelligence of
the child, a distinct and separate <i>unity</i>, is in vital,
spiritual, and synchronous relation to that of the
mother that enfolds it.</p>
<p>It is either building or rejuvenating a new
spiritual body, as the &#8220;essential form&#8221; of the
physical, organic, chemical, and kinetic or magnetic
body.</p>
<p>What we call &#8220;Life,&#8221; or &#8220;Vitality,&#8221; runs like
a &#8220;dominant chord&#8221; in the harmonic scale of the
whole. Each part, organ, and function is related to
every other and to the whole by definite vibrations
and the laws of harmony.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>If, from the beginning, it is an &#8220;unwelcome
child,&#8221; the higher and subtler elements of the
mother&#8217;s nature, and all her emotions are turned
against it, are discordant and not constructive and
harmonic.</p>
<p>Discord is thus ingrained at the foundations and
woven into the &#8220;subtle body&#8221; of the child.</p>
<p>Nature is so persistent in its determination to
preserve and perpetuate the human race, that the
building of the organic body of the child goes on;
and the Individual Intelligence is so potent that it
often triumphs over these prenatal obstructions, but
by no means always. If &#8220;there <i>is</i> a spiritual body&#8221;
in the mother organism during the present life,
as I am <i>entirely satisfied</i> there is; and if the child
is laying the foundation and weaving the pattern
and fabric of a spiritual body of its own for the
present life and that immediately beyond; then
these psychological influences and conditions are
of <i>transcendent importance</i> and <i>may</i> be largely
determined by our intelligent choice.</p>
<p>A higher race of beings will never inhabit this
earth till these fundamental laws are recognized
and regarded.</p>
<p>We may illustrate and symbolize this spiritual
habitation we are building by the over-tones and
the harmonics in music.</p>
<p>Its nature and function and the whole process of
building and development are a refining and purifying
process.</p>
<p>It may be conceived in the vito-magnetic field
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
of man, as that which is in nearest relation and
closest touch with the soul, the Individual Intelligence,
and through, and by which the soul acts.</p>
<p>Being in synchronous relation with the physical
organs and functions, like a chord in music, a high
with a lower tone (but still harmonic), the <i>direct</i>
vehicle and agent of the soul would be this spiritual
body; and when the physical body or vehicle dies,
or is cast off, the spiritual body <i>with the soul</i>
escapes.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence along just these lines is so
abundant in the annals of every people, and in all
ages, that it is unnecessary to quote it here. Whole
volumes are filled with it, outside the annals of
Spiritualism and the Psychical Society, and antedating
them by centuries and millenniums.</p>
<p>The most important consideration is that the
building of character by voluntary choice and personal
effort, the &#8220;growth of the soul,&#8221; and the
evolution of this spiritual body are <i>inseparable</i>.
This trinity which is man, is <i>potentially</i> (and may
be <i>actually</i>) a <i>unity</i>.</p>
<p>The evolutionary and devolutionary lines run in
precisely opposite directions, are easily differentiated
and defined, are usually recognized by observation
and by the individual himself. It is very
difficult and takes a long time to deceive ourselves
with regard to the upward or downward trend of
our own life, till we have blunted by misuse and
degraded all the finer faculties, capacities, and
powers of our being.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>A quickened conscience, a moral uplift, a desire
to do right, a noble ideal, mark the beginning; but
self-study, a rigid and persistent self-analysis, taking
account of stock of all our resources and capacities,
all our real possessions and opportunities, is
the scientific process by which man may become
master of his own life and evolve to higher and
still higher planes of being, even here in the present
life.</p>
<p>The question of rewards and punishments hereafter,
and what we may expect, or hope, or fear,
that we will <i>get</i>, will sink into utter nothingness
before the great and ever-growing question of what
we <i>are</i>, and what we are determined to <i>become</i>.</p>
<p>Incidentally with this dominating impulse and determination
will be the growth and development of
the spiritual body, and the intuition and guiding
light of the Individual Intelligence. We shall become
consciously <i>aware</i> of this as a constant personal
experience demanding no further proof. It
is <i>knowledge</i> of the soul <i>direct</i>.</p>
<p>Every faculty, capacity, and power of the soul
will be our willing servant.</p>
<p>This is Constructive Psychology, and is a normal
evolution under both Natural and Divine Law:
&#8220;Living the Life that we may know the doctrine.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is practical, scientific Psychology worked out
and demonstrated in the Laboratory of Life. Religions
and Revelations will no longer be mysteries,
but open books; for we shall be in touch with their
source and at-one with their inspiration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>This is what is meant by &#8220;The School of Natural
Science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor is it an idle speculation, nor merely a thing
&#8220;devoutly to be wished.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the whole nature of man is built and operated
under law; if he is, as he seems to be, an aggregate
of all substances, an epitome of all principles and
processes; then it follows that to understand these
laws, processes and correspondences, is to become
<i>master</i> of them and of life.</p>
<p>Wonderful as have been the discoveries in nature&#8217;s
finer forces and in applied science, all that science
has discovered or invented, or art has devised, is
like children&#8217;s toys, when compared with the subtle
and marvelous mechanism of man&#8217;s organism.</p>
<p>The rhythmic beating of the heart, synchronous
with respiration and the circulation of the blood,
are sufficient illustrations. But even this concerns
the vehicle, not the driver; the instrument, not the
player upon this &#8220;harp of a thousand strings.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to the mental and psychical realm,
cognition is direct and immediate. We become
&#8220;aware&#8221; of relations and processes, of sequences
and powers, by intuition, as we are <i>aware</i> of the
Self.</p>
<p>This is <i>apperception</i> in its highest sense. Not
through the mind, which is a <i>process</i> and a function,
but through that which uses, controls and dominates
the mind, viz.: the Individual Intelligence, the Soul.</p>
<p>In the mind, in daily life, <i>we</i> weigh and measure,
reason, choose, compare, and adjust. In intuition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
or apperception it is borne in, or comes like a
flash of light, and seems as if &#8220;we always knew
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We may somewhat haltingly describe the process,
but we can never impart the knowledge to another,
because it is an <i>individual experience</i>. As easily
could another feel, sense, and <i>realize</i> the pain of
thrusting our finger into the fire, as to receive
vicariously, from us, a <i>real</i> physical experience.</p>
<p>Here lies the difficulty, often the impossibility,
of the teacher or the Master, in imparting his
knowledge.</p>
<p>I am <i>entirety satisfied</i> that by personal effort
and experience along these lines of normal higher
evolution, there comes a time and a degree of unfoldment
and power when, from knowledge and
self-mastery, the Master&mdash;the Individual Intelligence&mdash;having
evolved and learned to <i>control</i> the
spiritual body, can consciously and deliberately pass
out of the physical body and return to it at will.
He can do this as consciously and completely as
it occurs at death; can go where he pleases, within
the range of his unfoldment or spiritual experience,
and retain conscious memory of it all after his return
to the physical body.</p>
<p>And suppose this all to be true, how can he
demonstrate the fact, or transmit the experience to
another; and particularly if that other declared to
begin with that, &#8220;the whole process is absurd and
impossible&#8221;?</p>
<p>Nor is mere credulity here a highway to knowledge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
It is merely the opposite pole of incredulity,
and both are begotten by ignorance.</p>
<p>Analogy and the basic principles and laws of
scientific psychology are very different matters
indeed. They point in this direction like a theorem
in mathematics. The principles and laws being
grasped and apprehended, the solution becomes
only a question of <i>work</i>; and at every step the law
is verified, &#8220;Backward and forward it still spells
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is this but the <i>methods</i> of Natural Science
applied to Psychical Science upon the basis of the
Unity of Natural Phenomena and Universal Law?</p>
<p>There is nothing to prevent any of us from starting
on this upward journey of the soul, if we
choose; and never till we do, shall we really begin
to <i>know</i>, to realize our birthright, and progress toward
the realm of eternal day.</p>
<p>The science of ethics, the basis of morals, is the
starting point, the first step; and <i>leading the life</i>,
the way. And there is no climbing up some other
way. So said the Master of Galilee, and so say
the real Masters in all times.</p>
<p>When Jesus said, &#8220;I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life,&#8221; he doubtless meant that these were all
<i>in him</i>, and he at-one with them.</p>
<p>When Jesus said, &#8220;I and the Father are <i>one</i>.
No one cometh to the Father but by me,&#8221; he doubtless
referred to this at-one-ment as the only way
by which the natural man&mdash;Adam&mdash;could become
the Spiritual man&mdash;<i>Christos</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>When he said, &#8220;The kingdom of heaven is within
you,&#8221; he undoubtedly meant that &#8220;heaven&#8221; is a
condition, a harmonic state, and not a place.</p>
<p>We undoubtedly create our own &#8220;hell&#8221; and our
own &#8220;heaven,&#8221; and people them with &#8220;devils&#8221; or
with &#8220;angels.&#8221;</p>
<p>True Science and true Religion clasp hands, and
are like the two hands of the one body of Truth.
They check each other, supplement each other,
harmonize each other.</p>
<p>Superstition and blind dogma are the enemies
of true Science; Religion&mdash;never.</p>
<p>Science and Religion are the handmaids of
Truth; because both are the children of Divinity,
the agents of Light and of Eternal Progress for
Man.</p>
<p>This building of character, this growth of the
soul, this Harmonic of Evolution, is a matter of
<i>work</i>; of personal endeavor, of valid, real, personal
experience.</p>
<p>Its results are our <i>real</i> possessions, our &#8220;treasure
in heaven&#8221; that nothing can ever destroy. Life
and Death may ebb and flow, and come and go;
but <i>we</i> may, if we will, go on forever; or we may
turn the other way and go down to death. <i>Some
day</i> every human soul will elect, choose, and
decide and then start on the journey, North or
South.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of Soul, of Individual Intelligence,
of Rational Volition, of Personal Responsibility.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>It is the Science of Nature aligned with Divinity,
and compassing Humanity.</p>
<p>The purpose of these outlines, suggestions,
analogies, and inferences, is to show that this life
is a period of gestation, in close analogy and comparable
with that of the child <i>in utero</i>; that with the
web and woof of character, organ and function,
impulse and use, opportunity and destiny, we are
building a spiritual body, the <i>immediate vehicle</i> of
the soul, as literally as is the physical body on the
outer material plane; that the laws of Spiritual
health and vitality are as concrete, apprehensible,
and demonstrable as those of physiology.</p>
<p>Normal use under law develops health, harmony,
and strength, in the one case as in the other,
demonstrably; and these laws, accurately formulated
and demonstrated, constitute the School of
Natural Science, accessible to all prepared to receive
and wisely use them; advancement depending on
progress, thoroughness, and loyalty, in all preceding
degrees.</p>
<p>Is it worth while?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE CROSS IN RELIGION AND THE CRUX IN SCIENCE WITH THE GREAT WORK IN AMERICA</h3>
</div>

<p>With the progress of civilization and the general
growth and diffusion of intelligence
everywhere, there is one problem upon which all else
focalizes, though the fact seems to be seldom clearly
apprehended or realized.</p>
<p>Not only do science and religion face each other
at one point, but the life of each is at that one
point involved. It is not only the often recognized
&#8220;conflict between Religion and Science,&#8221; which was
long ago worn threadbare. It is the fact that both
Science and Religion are out of joint with themselves.</p>
<p>The battle-ground may, in a broad way, be named
Psychology. All problems and all discussions of
the real issues arise from, involve, or center around,
the nature, laws that govern, and destiny of the
Human Soul.</p>
<p>From the very nature of these problems, their
intricacy and diversity, they remained the latest in
the categories of Science to be seriously investigated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>For the same reasons they have been the subject
of dogma and revelation in religion, with doors
slammed in the face of all investigation as not only
useless, but wicked, and often made dangerous.</p>
<p>Between the agnosticism of Science, and the
dogmatism of Religion, knowledge has been crucified,
and there it hangs to-day, a crux to the one,
and the Cross to the other: The same problem,
only facing different ways.</p>
<p>And yet the Reconciliation is not far to seek.
It is difficult for the average churchman, or theologian,
to apprehend and remember, that a <i>fact</i>, in
nature or in life, is one thing; and that the <i>interpretation</i>,
or <i>explanation</i> put upon that fact, by any
man, or body of men, is another thing entirely.
Here is where Belief, Dogma, and Heresy come in.
As soon as one denies the interpretation, he is
accused of denying the fact, no matter how illogical
or absurd the interpretation may be, on the one
hand, or how openly he admits the fact as the basis
of his own conclusions, on the other.</p>
<p>Few individuals will be found nowadays who
deny the <i>fact</i> of the birth, life, mission, and death
of Jesus of Nazareth. But the interpretations read
into the fact differ so widely as to result in almost
numberless sects, and an endless war of words.
All this theological wrangling may be focalized at
one point, almost on a single word. Did Jesus of
Nazareth differ in kind or in <i>Degree</i>, from the rest
of Humanity?</p>
<p>If he had &#8220;a like nature with ours,&#8221; as he and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
his disciples took the utmost pains to declare, and
to demonstrate, then he differed in <i>degree</i> of unfoldment,
and was indeed, our Elder Brother; He
differed as the holy differs from the unholy; as
the pure differs from the impure; as the kind and
charitable differ from the unkind and the uncharitable.
It is just at this point that all the
theological juggling comes in, in the effort to reconcile
contradictions and irreconcilable paradoxes,
under the designation&mdash;Mystery, Miracle, and
Faith. Few theologians would admit that it is
desirable, even if possible, that the mystery and
miracle should disappear, and that wisdom and
understanding should take their place. In other
words, that Jesus should be proved an evolution
under both natural and divine law, as the result of
&#8220;Living the Life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we are dealing with <i>Interpretations</i>
only, and with the opinions of men; and
that there is nothing &#8220;sacred&#8221; or &#8220;holy&#8221; about
these opinions, no matter how they may be hedged
about by dogma, or ecclesiastic authority. The
Immaculate Conception; the Virgin Birth; the
Resurrection of the physical body, and the Vicarious
Atonement, are each and all Dogmas; the opinions
of men, in <i>interpreting</i> the mystery, and miracle,
they have assigned to the nature of Jesus, in what
they call the &#8220;plan,&#8221; or the &#8220;Scheme of Salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the nature of Jesus were radically and essentially
different from ours; if he differed from us in
<i>kind</i>, instead of in <i>degree</i>; if he were &#8220;very God,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
instead of a perfected man, as the result of &#8220;Living
the Life&#8221;; then he can have little in common with
us; and, so far as &#8220;like natures,&#8221; &#8220;common temptations,&#8221;
and human sympathies, and destinies, are
concerned, he might as well have been born on the
planet Mars.</p>
<p>But suppose that psychic and spiritual science
could so define the faculties, capacities, and powers
of man, and the nature and laws of the human
soul, as to demonstrate the fact that Jesus became
<i>Christos</i> through &#8220;living the life,&#8221; and &#8220;doing the
will of the Father,&#8221; in strict conformity to both
Natural and Divine Law, thus revealing the fact
that these <i>potencies</i> are <i>latent</i> in every human
soul: that it does not depend so much upon what
we <i>believe</i>, as upon what we <i>do</i>; not so much upon
what we <i>profess</i>, as upon what we <i>are</i>; not so much
upon what Jesus did for us, as upon what we do
for ourselves and for others, in strict analogy with
the life and the teachings of Jesus. Would not
Jesus become, indeed and in truth, a <i>Living Example</i>,
in place of a &#8220;Blood Offering&#8221;?</p>
<p>Theology ignores and sophisticates <i>Personal
Responsibility</i>, which everything else, and every
experience in life, justifies and enforces as the basis
of Morals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, so-called Psychic Science
misapprehends, belittles, and sophisticates the
Human Will, the prime Motor Power of Man. It
then confuses Rational Volition and Domination by
juggling with the words <i>Suggestion</i> and <i>Hypnosis</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>This reveals the fact that they have no rational
concept whatever of the psychical nature of man,
not even a &#8220;working hypothesis&#8221; of the Human
Soul. Theologians affirm, &#8220;Science&#8221; denies, and
so they still face each other in this Twentieth Century
with &#8220;A war of words,&#8221; though, to a considerable
extent, they have ceased making faces and
calling each other names, because there is a deeper
struggle going on.</p>
<p>The Theological Hierarchy, worldly-wise in every
generation, has dropped the cry of <i>Heresy</i> and
gone to the very foundations of our civilization.
They are sapping and mining the foundations of
civil Liberty, the &#8220;self-evident truths,&#8221; and the
&#8220;Inalienable Rights,&#8221; upon which this government
was founded.</p>
<p>Here is a thoroughly-organized, relentless determination,
openly declared, and well under way
to destroy our &#8220;Free Public Schools,&#8221; and substitute
that &#8220;Organized Ignorance,&#8221; the Parochial
Schools, as the first step in reuniting Church and
State, through dogmatic authority instilled into the
youths of this country. Not one citizen in a thousand
seems to realize what is here being attempted,
how thoroughly organized it is, or what immense
progress in this direction has already been made;
or, if they know, they do not seem to care.</p>
<p>It may thus be seen what practical and vital
issues we are facing and how much is involved in
the &#8220;Cross of Religion,&#8221; and the &#8220;Crux of Science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intelligence, Education, the Light of Science,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
and the Illumination of true Religion, are pitted
in a conflict with Ignorance, Superstition, and Fear;
dogmatism, degeneration, and devolution.</p>
<p>Science and Religion represent different departments
in human interests and the life of man. So
far as they are each true, they must eventually,
and inevitably clasp hands, instead of working at
cross-purposes.</p>
<p>Actual knowledge of the human soul, as a Science
of psychology, on the one hand; and the duty of
man to himself, to his fellows, and to God, and
the destiny of the human soul as essential religion,
on the other; must constitute the basis of union,
and the point of agreement.</p>
<p>The accredited psychology of to-day has hitherto
failed to demonstrate any actual knowledge of the
human soul, or even to postulate its existence, as a
fact in nature.</p>
<p>The theologies and religions of to-day appeal
largely to superstition and fear, and support their
dogmas by &#8220;revelations,&#8221; the diverse interpretations
of which have segregated religions into a
large number of sects with no bond of union or
basis of agreement.</p>
<p>Competition here, in securing proselytes, differs
little, except in name, from that everywhere in
evidence between commercial organizations. It is
hardly &#8220;the survival of the fittest,&#8221; but rather, as
everywhere, and in all ages, the triumph of the
most powerful, aggressive, and unscrupulous. The
Roman Hierarchy is still in the lead, with its Pope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
&#8220;infallible,&#8221; and anathematizing all progress and
enlightenment, under the designation of &#8220;Modernism,&#8221;
and all its energy exerted to perpetuate
the &#8220;Dark Ages.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is thus that priestcraft masquerades in the
name of religion to enslave the human soul. Still
outside this Babel of religion and science, lie numberless
cults and organizations professing both liberty
and enlightenment along the lines of man&#8217;s
spiritual nature, not one of which puts forth any
<i>clear and definite theorem</i> of the human soul. With
mere assertions, instead of demonstrated facts, and
appealing often to the desire for wealth, health, and
comfort in their followers, they often declare that
one has only to &#8220;<i>demand</i>&#8221; these things, in order to
have them. Justice and the law of compensation
are often entirely ignored, and the methods employed
are <i>un</i>moral, to say the least, almost without
exception, unscientific, and wholly empirical.</p>
<p>Occasionally we find &#8220;Leaders,&#8221; or &#8220;Official
Heads,&#8221; whose colossal ignorance of either moral
or spiritual Law, is only equaled by their monumental
egotism, and this does not prevent them
from gaining proselytes, and amassing fortunes in
their own name.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to see how many of these
cults differ, either in principle or practice, or in the
results wrought out in their disciples, from the
Priestcraft already referred to.</p>
<p>They advertise an open thoroughfare, and seem
to promise something for nothing, but from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
vicarious atonement, up or down the scale, the
votaries pay in &#8220;mint, anise, and cummin,&#8221; while
ignorantly blind to the weightier matters of the law.</p>
<p>To one who for half a century has studied these
personal and social problems, and witnessed the
rise and fall of many of these cults, from the Fox
Sisters and Spiritualism, to Braid and Hypnotism,
while Priestcraft and Popery, like Tennyson&#8217;s brook,
&#8220;go on forever,&#8221; it all seems pitiful that mankind
must pay so dearly for freedom, enlightenment, and
knowledge.</p>
<p>And yet, when the real teacher comes, the rabble
so long exploited cry, &#8220;Away with him,&#8221; &#8220;Crucify
him.&#8221; When the rabble at last repent, Priestcraft
shifts its tactics and deifies the sacrifice, which it
instigated, and so perpetuates the eternal tragedy.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the &#8220;Seeking after God,&#8221;
and for real knowledge of the essential nature of
man, in all ages, are aware that there have always
been, in every age, those who have achieved it.
It has been known, or rather concealed, under many
names. Its possessors and teachers have been reviled,
persecuted, crucified, and thus their work has
been hindered and often defeated.</p>
<p>The ignorant and superstitious feared it. The
vicious, ambitious, and time-serving hated it, because
it prevented the few from dominating and exploiting
the many; liberating, as it does, the earnest
seeker after truth and enlightenment from the
bondage of ignorance, dogma, superstition, and
fear, in every form.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Hence Institutional Religions, Schools of Philosophy,
Coteries, Syndicates, and many other organizations
of men, constituted to dominate and
rule the masses, have been the sworn foes of individual
liberty and enlightenment, and of the
&#8220;Illuminati,&#8221; or real teachers in every age, and a
perpetual menace to their work.</p>
<p>Real knowledge of the nature and destiny of
man, has first to be discovered, then recovered, and
possessed. To become available, it must be simplified,
formulated, and finally promulgated in some
form, so as to reach those ready and capable of
receiving it.</p>
<p>It must be sought earnestly and deservedly. The
candidate must demonstrate that he is duly and
truly prepared, worthy, and well qualified. Every
step in advance is determined by his understanding
and use of what he has hitherto received.</p>
<p>The real possession of this sublime wisdom is an
evolution from within and not something communicated
from without.</p>
<p>It is, literally, the building of character and
the growth of the soul, as the highway of knowledge.</p>
<p>To discover, possess, exemplify, and promulgate
this knowledge, this higher evolution of the Individual
Intelligence, in the face of all obstacles and
difficulties, has been known and designated for
ages as the <i>Magnum Opus</i>, the &#8220;Great Work.&#8221; It
is, indeed, the greatest work either known, permitted
or possible to man. It solves the riddle of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Sphinx of Life and makes Man Master of his own
destiny.</p>
<p>Such a Master lives in a new world, untrammeled
by the things of sense and time. He has
indeed, &#8220;lived the life to know the doctrine,&#8221; and
can say with Jesus, in sincerity and truth, &#8220;I, and
the Father, are One,&#8221; because we are <i>at-one</i>.</p>
<p>There is not a particle of evidence in history, in
philosophy, or in science, to show that anyone has
ever reached such knowledge, liberation, and enlightenment,
in any other way than that in which
Jesus attained it; viz.: by renouncing the ordinary
ambitions of life, wealth, fame, and power, and by
overcoming selfishness and the lusts of the flesh;
devoting their lives to the good of mankind, &#8220;without
the hope of fee or reward.&#8221; As the whole work
is a spiritual unfoldment, and from beginning to
end a refining process, it is easy to see how and why
the conditions are what they are, and have always
been the same.</p>
<p>This is why those who have no apprehension or
conception of the process, can see only mystery
and miracle in the result.</p>
<p>If anyone cites the so-called &#8220;black magicians&#8221;
of Egypt, and of antiquity, to refute the moral code
as the essential condition of attainment, they will
find that these priests and &#8220;magi climbing up
some other way,&#8221; and whom Jesus designated as
&#8220;thieves and robbers,&#8221; could never function or pass
beyond the so-called &#8220;astral plane.&#8221; Here is where
the Sibyl and the &#8220;virgin seer&#8221; came in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>This is clearly shown in that little book &#8220;The
Idyll of the White Lotus,&#8221; as in several of Bulwer&#8217;s
novels. Hypnotism and Ceremonial Magic, as revealed
in the writings of Abbé Constant, represent
ambition for knowledge and power without &#8220;living
the life,&#8221; and at any cost to mankind. These
<i>Margraves</i> have often existed, sealed their own
fate, and &#8220;gone to their own place.&#8221; H. P.
Blavatsky referred to them as &#8220;lost souls,&#8221; or
&#8220;soulless individuals.&#8221; They are also graphically
described in &#8220;The Strange Story of Arinzeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was always the &#8220;Right-hand Path,&#8221; and
the &#8220;Left-hand Path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even a slight familiarity with ancient literatures
and philosophies reveals the fact, that all these
things have been known for ages. The subtlety
of the Hindoo mind has been such as to leave no
phase of mental or psychic phenomena uninvestigated.</p>
<p>To the casual and uninstructed reader, it often
seems like an endless and hopeless jungle, and he is
unable to bring order out of the seemingly endless
confusion.</p>
<p>There is not a single percept or concept in what
is now called &#8220;New Thought,&#8221; that may not be
found repeated with almost endless variations thousands
of years ago.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the conditions
imposed upon the student who aspires to know,
and to become.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>The obligations upon the teacher are no less
stringent, for both are, from first to last, working
under both natural and spiritual law to which they
are bound to conform.</p>
<p>To be possessed of such knowledge the teacher
must have abandoned worldly ambition, the love
of wealth, and the applause of men. All motives
of time-serving and self-seeking must assail him in
vain. He becomes the almoner of the treasure-house
of Light and Knowledge. He must exemplify
what he teaches. If he can impart his knowledge,
or assist an aspiring and worthy brother, it
must be in the way he has himself received it,
&#8220;without money and without price,&#8221; or any &#8220;hope
of reward or fee,&#8221; and the brother so receiving, in
his own degree, must be ready to pass it on under
precisely the same terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The teacher, therefore, must be in a position to
give or to withhold; promulgate or conceal; teach
or refuse to teach; governed solely by Truth and
Law, and the solemn obligation under which he has
himself received it.</p>
<p>The meaning of the saying, &#8220;strait is the gate
and narrow is the way, and few there be who find
it,&#8221; may thus be made apparent.</p>
<p>Fragments of this wisdom are found scattered
through the ages, with here and there one who has
achieved it.</p>
<p>For two or three centuries the early Christian
Church undertook to work on these lines, and instituted
three degrees, as abundantly shown in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
writings of many of the so-called &#8220;Christian, or
Church Fathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus said to his disciples, &#8220;I have many things
to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&#8221;
And again, &#8220;The works that I do, ye shall do also,
and greater things than these shall ye do, because
I go to the Father.&#8221; And again, &#8220;Unto you it is
given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them who are without, it is not
given.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mysteries, indeed, to the ignorant monks who
were already wrangling over creed, and dogmas,
and who, in 325 at the First Council at Nice,
fought it out surrounded by the soldiers of the
Pagan Emperor, Constantine; and thus settled the
&#8220;orthodox <i>interpretation</i>,&#8221; of what they were
wholly incompetent to understand. Their successors
are still engaged in the same wrangle of
interpretation, so far as the &#8220;Infallible Pope,&#8221; and
dogma of obedience, at Rome has been unable to
suppress it.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the middle of the first and
second centuries, an effort at union and reconciliation
arose from another quarter. Ammonius Saccas,
a Neo-Platonist, endeavored to unite men of different
cults and beliefs on the lines of the Great Work,
precisely as the Philalethean Society is doing in
New York to-day; but his movement was soon
engulfed and lost sight of by the tide of Ecclesiasticism,
or suppressed by the soldiers of Constantine.</p>
<p>I am not attempting a history, for that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
fill volumes. I am only giving a few sidelights of
the Great Work.</p>
<p>In the Tenth Century, at Baghdad, a society
was formed admitting Jews, Christians, Mohammedans,
and atheists, with a similar purpose.</p>
<p>During the time of Martin Luther, John Reuchlin
made a similar attempt. Both Reuchlin and
Luther were pupils of Trithemius, the Abbot of St.
Jacob&#8217;s at Würzburg, one of whose books I possess,
printed in the year 1600, and also another book,
&#8220;The Theosophical Transactions of the Philadelphian
Society,&#8221; printed in London in 1697. Browning&#8217;s
&#8220;Paracelsus&#8221; gives a splendid outline of the
philosophy and teachings of Trithemius, and rescues
Paracelsus with all who can understand, from the
vile slanders of his monkish enemies; and Robert
Browning wrote his &#8220;Paracelsus&#8221; at the age of
twenty-three! Can you wonder why so few &#8220;understand
Browning&#8221;?</p>
<p>For more than fifteen hundred years mankind
has been involved between the speculations of Philosophy,
on the one hand, and the creeds and
dogmas of Theology, on the other.</p>
<p>There was also the deliberate destruction of
ancient monuments, scrolls, and records, by religious
fanatics. Diocletian, in A.D. 296, burned the
books of the Egyptians. Cæsar burned 700,000
Rolls at Alexandria, and Leo Isaurus 300,000 at
Constantinople in the eighth century. Then came
the Mohammedans, who destroyed the remainder of
the accessible scrolls at Alexandria. Gangs of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
fanatical Monks, Christian and Pagan, roamed
over Europe destroying and defacing everything
upon which they could lay their hands, as witnesses
against their dogmas and superstitions. Even to-day,
in India, it is difficult for Europeans to gain
access to genuine ancient records. The records of
these barbarities are still fresh in the minds of the
guardians of sacred lore.</p>
<p>Even with such a record for thousands of years,
Ecclesiasticism is as arrogant and rampant as ever
to-day. The wonder is, that there is anything left
but barbarism.</p>
<p>Two writers declare that the most ancient and
valuable of the records of the Alexandrian Library
were kept in secret crypts known only to the highest
officials, and preserved still in secret crypts
known only to the Illuminati. In Baalbec and all
through the East to-day these underground temples
are being explored, and even the fragments found
excite wonder and admiration. Ignorant Barbarians
may be destructive on general principles, but
fanatical Ecclesiasticism has ever been destructive
of all light, knowledge and civilization, through
insane hatred or pure &#8220;cussedness&#8221;! We need
only to regard intelligently what it has done, and is
doing for Southern Europe to-day.</p>
<p>Can you wonder that the real science of the
Human Soul found little recognition, or that it was
denied as possible to man?</p>
<p>As already shown, the Science of to-day has
neither recognized nor worked up to it; and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Theology of to-day covers it with fable, mystery,
and miracle as of old.</p>
<p>In spite of both these the &#8220;Philalethean Society&#8221;
exists, the &#8220;Seekers after God&#8221; were never more
numerous than now, and the <i>Magnum Opus</i>, the
Great Work, was never, in the whole history of man,
more in evidence than it is to-day.</p>

<p>Can it be that there is no great truth back of all
these struggles and aspirations of the human soul?
That there is no possible realization back of these
soulful endeavors?</p>
<p>Is Tantalus, after all, the creator and Father of
Man? inspired only by love of disappointment,
defeat, and despair, in his children?</p>
<p><i>For one, I do not believe it.</i></p>
<p>To plant these aspirations in the soul of man,
and doom them to everlasting disappointment and
defeat, would brand the creator of man as an
Infinite Liar, instead of a Loving Father.</p>
<p>The earnest student must first learn to recognize,
and to discriminate; for the &#8220;blind leaders of the
blind&#8221; are always legions.</p>
<p>This power of discrimination, to which I have
referred, goes deeper, and means far more, than
most persons ever realize, and this is why so many
are continually deceived.</p>
<p>It is the light of understanding, of spiritual intelligence,
within the soul of man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>It may be likened to a traveler in a foreign
country, and a strange land, suddenly hearing one
speaking fluently his own language, his native
tongue. It is impossible to deceive him. In this
case, however, it is not the mere words, the inflection
or pronunciation, but the ideas, sentiments,
and principles expressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,&#8221; for example;
or sympathy, Charity, and loving kindness.</p>
<p>The &#8220;sign of the Master&#8221; is at once recognized
by one already prepared to receive and to understand
it. The soul that really desires truth and
wisdom above all things, has thereby developed the
power to recognize it.</p>
<p>This is the discrimination referred to. It is not
what someone else tells you, or what another claims.
It is what <i>you</i> discern and recognize, and the teaching
and the life are in perfect harmony, like chords
in music; and they strike a harmonic chord in you,
that may be first a surprise, and soon a great joy
and a bright light.</p>
<p>It is not a question of authority, and of credentials,
but of intrinsic reality. You must know
how to assay and test the gold yourself. This is
where the &#8220;Alchemy of the Great Work&#8221; comes
in, and here lies the beginning of Adeptship, the
preparation for the &#8220;Great Work.&#8221; I can demonstrate
this from a score of old books, some of
them going back many centuries.</p>
<p>It has also been symbolized and picturegraphed
&#8217;til the imagination ran riot, and ingenuity and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
fancy became lost, like ideas in a fantasy of words.</p>
<p>I know of but one place, one Institution, in
modern times, where these essential truths of the
Great Work have been preserved as a consistent
whole, and that is in the symbolism of Free Masonry,
but the craft long ago lost the real interpretation,
though many to-day are on the lines that
lead to it.</p>
<p>The whole symbolism and ritual of the Blue
Lodge in Masonry is, from beginning to end,
<i>a symbol of the journey of the human soul on this
earth</i>, from darkness to light; from sin to righteousness;
from ignorance to wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>In other words, it is an exact <i>theorem</i> and solution
of the <i>Magnum Opus</i>; a symbol of the philosophy
and accomplishment of the GREAT
WORK.</p>
<p>The science and the theology of the present
day have been briefly contrasted. Neither of them
pretends to give us any real science of the human
soul.</p>
<p>Science says frankly she &#8220;does not know.&#8221; Theology
bids us believe and obey; trust and hope.
Philosophy speculates and reasons, while amusing
itself with the kaleidoscope of &#8220;postulates&#8221; and
&#8220;categories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Science must deal with facts, demonstrate their
actuality, and classify them; that is, find their
natural order and sequence.</p>
<p>In psychology, the facts are <i>within</i> the realm of
consciousness, and therefore their demonstration is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
a matter of individual experience. This is why
psychology differs from all other sciences.</p>
<p>No one can transfer his individual experiences
directly to another. He can describe how he gained
them, and give the result and conclusions, and here
is where those who know nothing of the real problem,
are often both incredulous and contemptuous.
The only answer to these is, &#8220;they are joined to
their idols, let them alone.&#8221; &#8220;They would not believe
though one arose from the dead,&#8221; and yet we
are told again and again that the &#8220;School of
Natural Science&#8221; is the &#8220;school of personal experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be well to reflect a moment, and ask
ourselves, how it is that we really know anything?
Is it not through personal experience? Real
knowledge comes, and can come, in no other way.</p>
<p>No teacher of the real science of psychology can
ever transmit or transfer his knowledge to another.
All he can do is to describe the methods, and steps,
by which he acquired it, and assist the student in
acquiring it for himself in the same way, or under
the same processes and laws.</p>
<p>We have only to reflect on the ordinary experiences
of life, to realize that this is a universal
principle and rule. In the deeper science of the
soul, and the higher life, instead of this law being
relaxed, it becomes all the more binding.</p>
<p>Do not the principles that adhere in atom, molecule
and mass, still hold in worlds and solar systems?
Is not this precisely what is meant by &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Reign of Law&#8221;? If man were built upon some
other scheme or plan than the rest of nature, how
could he apprehend or adjust himself to Nature?
The very <i>concept</i> of miracle is <i>lawlessness</i>, and
mystery is but another name for <i>ignorance</i>.</p>
<p>Knowledge means experience and apprehension
of Law.</p>
<p>Neither can the laws of Nature and the laws of
God be at cross-purposes, for that would make
harmony impossible and inconceivable.</p>
<p>The confusion and discord are all in us, and the
Great Work means adjustment, harmony, and then
Knowledge.</p>
<p>It is the journey of the human soul on the
Royal Highway to Light, Liberation, and Eternal
Day.</p>
<p>For many centuries those who have achieved this
Wisdom, this &#8220;Great Work,&#8221; have been trying to
make it accessible to mankind, and to place it in
such form that the ethical, scientific, and philosophical
principles involved, and upon which it is based,
should not again be lost. Every such effort has
hitherto failed.</p>
<p>The scientific spirit of the present age, in a very
broad way, seemed to offer a new and a more advantageous
opportunity; for the whole process is
one of strict science.</p>
<p>The Psychology of the present day has become
involved in phenomena and automatism, and is in no
sense <i>constructive</i>. It is one thing to build theories,
and quite a different thing to systematize demonstrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
facts, through the recognition of co-ordinate
relations, and underlying law.</p>
<p>The work is open and accessible to all who manifest
real interest, an open mind, and who have the
intelligence and discrimination to recognize the character
of the work. It has never, in the history of
man, been open in any other way, on any other
terms, or to any other individuals.</p>
<p>Those who can fill these requirements constitute
to-day a larger number than have before existed
at any one time, for perhaps many centuries.</p>
<p>The &#8220;School of Natural Science&#8221; is in evidence.
The &#8220;Great Work&#8221; is carefully outlined.</p>
<p>There is no bar to one&#8217;s making a beginning on
the path, except indifference, incredulity, preoccupation,
or prejudice; and these need not be in the
least disturbed, for they will be kindly and courteously
passed by.</p>
<p>Arguments, controversy, and proselyting, have
no part in the Great Work, as there is no organization,
and no personal ambitions to serve.</p>
<p>Those who speak a common language, are inspired
by a common purpose, and aspire to a common and
universal good, will, soon or late, find themselves
associated together and co-operating.</p>
<p>It is like a chorus of voices when an old song
is started that we loved in childhood. Each takes
up the strain, falls into his own part, and helps
to swell the harmony, from the joy of his own
heart.</p>
<p>Those who &#8220;never did like the song,&#8221; will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
&#8220;quietly steal away.&#8221; Both Swedenborg and
Emerson have sufficiently illustrated the &#8220;Law of
Correspondencies,&#8221; and &#8220;compensation,&#8221; to reveal
the basis of all harmonious human associations,
whether on the earth, or on other planes of being.
Hence the &#8220;Harmonics of Evolution,&#8221; was the
forerunner of the &#8220;Great Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pitiable byplay and claptrap of &#8220;Affinities&#8221;
so often seen and heard nowadays, where all
previous obligations are ignored, and personal responsibilities
set at naught, only serve to emphasize
the real law of harmony and constructive evolution,
by showing what it is not.</p>
<p>The Great Work digs to the very foundations
of life, and all human associations, and reveals the
Good, the True, and the Beautiful, in the building
of character, and the adornment of the Temple
of the Human Soul.</p>
<p>This is indeed&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Eternal Progress moving on,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>From state to state the spirit walks.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Death is neither the end nor the beginning. It
is only a change in pitch, a shifting of keys, and
the same old Song of Life goes on, if we have
but learned the score, and caught the harmony.</p>
<p>Salvation is not a thing accomplished once for
all. We have only to consider the monotony, the
poverty of invention, and imagination, of those who
have tried to portray the joy of the Redeemed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
heaven, in order to realize what a bore it would soon
become, if that were all.</p>
<p>Inspiration, achievement, and eternal progress,
with more and more helpfulness to others, with
plane after plane achieved, revealing plane after
plane beyond&mdash;does not this appeal far more
strongly to the highest and best in us all?</p>
<p>And pray, what is this, but the <i>Great Work</i>, that
I have tried herein to outline, and as taught and
lived by Jesus, and every great Master the world
has ever known? Each has achieved in his own
degree, worded it in his own way, and &#8220;stepped
out of sunlight into shade, to make more room for
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long before the birth of Jesus, it was said, &#8220;The
wise and peaceful ones live, renewing the earth like
the coming of Spring.&#8221; And having themselves
crossed the ocean of embodied existence, help all
those who try to do the same thing, without personal
motive.</p>
<p>I have endeavored to give a general outline of
the Great Work, drawn from history, tradition,
philosophy, and symbolism, down to the present
year of grace. I find many corroborations, many
things pointing in the same general direction. But
I find but one concise and definite <i>formulation</i> of
the <i>scientific theorem</i>, in which the outline is clear,
and the analogy complete, and thereby made accessible
and apprehensible to the open-minded and intelligent
student.</p>
<p>Such students need experience no real difficulty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
in finding a clew to the labyrinth of life, or, as our
ancient brothers put it in regard to the <i>Magnum
Opus</i>&mdash;&#8220;a key to the closed palace of the king.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the &#8220;Harmonic Series&#8221;
of books. They need rest upon no authority beyond
the intrinsic evidence of truth, on every page. If
they are not consistent in themselves, then they
must fall in pieces. The only appeal to the reader
is: read them carefully, analyze your own mind and
soul, and come to your own conclusions. If they
find no response, no answering chord in you,
then they were written for someone else, or in
vain.</p>
<p>One further consideration remains to be noted at
this time, as the question is sure to arise: &#8220;How
about woman in the Great Work?&#8221; Seldom in the
past has she received recognition, since the earliest
days in Old India, though here and there have been
the most noble women.</p>
<p>I heard Anna Dickinson, many years ago, open
one of her famous lectures with these words, &#8220;I
claim for man and woman alike, the right to attempt
and win. I claim for man and woman alike, the
right to attempt and fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems to me to-day, as it did more than thirty
years ago, that this is the whole problem in a nutshell,
and that any number of words could add nothing
to the statement.</p>
<p>The Great Work is as open to woman as to
man, and on the same terms. They have perhaps
more to overcome in some directions, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
men more in others. This is like saying, &#8220;man and
woman are different,&#8221; that is all.</p>
<p>One thing is certain; there will never be an
ideal social state on earth, or a heaven anywhere,
except as men and women <i>co-operate</i> together for
the happiness of each, and the highest, noblest,
cleanest good of all, and this is only another phase
or department of the Great Work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE MODULUS OF NATURE AND THE THEOREM OF PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
</div>

<p>The Science of Psychology, like any other
science, must deal with demonstrated facts,
classify them, and systematize the resulting categories.</p>
<p>Strictly logical conclusions drawn from categories
of facts so derived, deserve the name of Science.</p>
<p>Science is, therefore, a definite method of arriving
at exact conclusions. No other method can legitimately
bear the name of science.</p>
<p>No one pretends to dispute the conclusions logically
involved in the Binomial Theorem; or in the
Parallelogram of forces; or in correlative mechanical
equivalents; or in many of the known laws of chemistry
and physiology.</p>
<p>When, however, we come to mental processes and
psychical phenomena, the facts are so redundant,
and so differently reported and apprehended, that
argument, belief and prejudice, credulity and incredulity,
overshadow and drown with a war of
words all clear, scientific methods or conclusions.</p>
<p>But if man, as a whole, is a fact in nature; or if
&#8220;God made Man a Living Soul,&#8221; then the whole
nature of man exists under law, and is apprehensible
to science.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Man&#8217;s function as a scientist is to read, to reflect,
to weigh, to measure, and to understand.</p>
<p>There are those who object to Natural Science as
applied to &#8220;Divine&#8221; things. They would preserve
the mystery, and seem to prefer miracle and dogma
to knowledge and law.</p>
<p>Their preference is to be respected, even though
ignorance and superstition result. Since the domain
of science, in America at least, is no longer restricted
by ecclesiastic law, the conflict between Religion and
Science has gradually disappeared, and the conflict
is rather that between knowledge and ignorance,
with ignorance on the wane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things settled by long use, if not absolutely
good, at least fit well together.&#8221;</p>
<p>This transition period seems confusing to many
earnest souls with its &#8220;New Thought,&#8221; its &#8220;occultisms&#8221;
and its &#8220;Lo here&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;Lo there&#8217;s.&#8221; But
through and beneath it all, may be heard a note of
harmony, the promise and the potency of the triumph
of light and knowledge.</p>
<p>We may not know the final results, but every
sincere and earnest seeker may have the peaceful
assurance that he is on the open highway that
leads to the noblest and the best.</p>
<p>The assurance of knowledge but makes clearer
the revelations of faith.</p>
<p>That &#8220;absentee God&#8221;&mdash;of which Carlyle wrote,
has been discerned as the Universal Intelligence,
and equally Love and Law.</p>
<p>Among recent writers and books on the subject
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
of psychology, Professor Hugo Münsterberg&#8217;s
&#8220;Psychotherapy&#8221; occupies a very high place. It
appeals especially to the physician, more familiar
than others with morbid psychical states. Here I
can look back on almost half a century of experience,
the most active, in dealing with these cases.</p>
<p>But I am at present less concerned with mental
pathology and therapy, than with the general psychological
basis; the <i>causative</i> categories upon which
they are based, and which occupy the first half of
Münsterberg&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>Dividing the whole subject&mdash;the content of consciousness,
all the faculties, capacities and powers,
all processes and sequences&mdash;into two general groups
or classes, the <i>purposive</i> and the <i>causal</i>, Münsterberg
declares that &#8220;the <i>causal</i> view only is the view
of psychology&#8221;; &#8220;the <i>purposive</i> view lies outside of
psychology.&#8221; (P. 14.)</p>
<p>I hold, that without the <i>purposive</i> view equally
included and co-ordinated, there can be no such
thing as Scientific Psychology. Half views will
hardly admit of synthetic generalizations.</p>
<p>The complete separation here instituted, between
the purposive and causal factors, in itself, for purposes
of definition and study, need not be objected
to, if it were consistently carried out, which it is
not. He so nearly pre-empts the whole ground for
the <i>causal</i>, giving scant courtesy to the <i>purposive</i>,
merely a few crumbs of comfort, so that it cannot
be said to be ignored altogether, and drops the
scientific method entirely in dealing with it; assenting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
to moral precepts and principles, without a
clew to any scientific basis, that one must object
to the <i>name</i>&mdash;Psychology&mdash;as being applied to it
at all. It contains no hint of a &#8220;knowledge of the
Soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the Vito-Motor mechanism of the Mind.
The Automatism of the elements, incidents, changes,
and sequences of our states of consciousness; based
upon, and including all that we know of physiology.
Along these lines, Münsterberg&#8217;s work has probably
never been equaled. It is concise, comprehensive,
and exhaustive.</p>
<p>His physical, physiological, and mental syntheses
are well-nigh complete.</p>
<p>Whenever, in the future, what he calls &#8220;the <i>purposive</i>
view&#8221; shall be resurrected from the obscurity
and nescience to which he has assigned it, and
really habilitated in the garb of Science, and recognized
as the lawful spouse of the <i>causal</i>, we shall
indeed have a true Psychology, a Science of the
Human Soul.</p>
<p>Münsterberg neither scouts nor denies the possibility
of such a future discovery. In the meantime,
his viewpoint, and necessarily some of his conclusions
and generalizations, are one-sided, and out of
focus.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the <i>causal</i> as he does, this could
hardly be otherwise; and from this point of view,
and for this reason, his practical Psychotherapy is
purely empirical.</p>
<p>We need not deny his facts, or his results, even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
when mixed with hypnosis, more than he does the
&#8220;cures&#8221; in &#8220;Christian Science,&#8221; &#8220;Faith Cures,&#8221;
at Lourdes, or by the &#8220;laying on of hands.&#8221; All
these things are too well known, and not one of them
deserves the name of Science. They are solely
empirical methods. Münsterberg&#8217;s broader view
and deeper analysis give to his methods great prominence,
and he can point to no results that transcend
the others. These facts and these results
are as old as the history of man. They have,
even as he points out, constituted epidemics of
&#8220;cure.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is, moreover, a scientific view and method
regarding what he calls the purposive view which
he overlooks entirely, and which by emphasis of the
causal, makes seemingly impossible. It is our purpose
to try and make this clear.</p>
<p>His analysis of Suggestion, though largely automatic,
is well-nigh exhaustive. Awareness, and Attention,
are illustrated copiously; but not clearly
differentiated as they may be, and actually are in
the experience of individual life.</p>
<p>Fortunately, and wisely, he eliminates the &#8220;Subconscious&#8221;
as having no real meaning or scientific
value as now used.</p>
<p>But it might be applied to the Mental awareness
of physiological automatism (bodily habits, often
beginning in an act of will, or attention; writing,
speaking, music, dancing, and the like, and in less
degree, all life impulses and movements below the
line of attention or awareness).
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>If, by courtesy, these might be called sub-conscious,
then there is another group above the
habitual plane of awareness, that, by equal courtesy,
might be called Supra-conscious. But, unless it is
remembered, as Münsterberg points out, that, regardless
of phenomena, <i>Consciousness is one</i>, these
terms can only lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Certain cases designated &#8220;multiple&#8221; or &#8220;dissociated
personalities&#8221; have only served to increase
this confusion still further; and more especially,
when the effort has been made to patch them together,
or to control them from without, by hypnosis.
The well-known case of &#8220;Sally,&#8221; reported
by Dr. Morton Prince, stands at last, as a &#8220;personally
conducted&#8221; psychological excursion, with
Sally still preserving her incognito, and as much
a mystery as ever.</p>
<p>That automatism incident to all progressive organization
and perfection of function, and through
which physical, physiological, mental, and psychic
synthesis becomes possible, has been allowed to
usurp the place of the &#8220;Builder of the Temple,&#8221;
the &#8220;Driver of the Chariot,&#8221; and the &#8220;Player&#8221; upon
the &#8220;Harp of a thousand strings.&#8221; Harmony and
equilibrium are incidents resulting from <i>causative</i>
processes! We need only to know the construction,
relations of parts, and principles involved in the
vibrations of the Harp, in order to understand and
appreciate the music. The player, the musician&mdash;drunk,
or sober, tone-blind or genius&mdash;is a mere
incident, and however <i>purposive</i> or competent, is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
admitted by courtesy only, and warned not to interfere
too much with the Harp!</p>
<p>To build, and keep in order, and tune the Harp,
constitutes the science of music. Some day, when
we have leisure and inclination, we may turn our
attention to the Musician, but that day seems far
off. We admit that his function is <i>purposive</i>. He,
no doubt, has designs on the Harp, and upon us, but
we are handling musical instruments at present,
and if he objects to our calling ourselves &#8220;Musicians&#8221;
(psychologists) he is impertinent, and
should study the science of music, or keep silent.</p>
<p>I am not &#8220;begging the question&#8221; in regard to the
human soul. I am simply emphasizing the fact of
the Individual Intelligence, which, at the point of
equilibrium, sweeps the strings with that harmony
which is the soul of music.</p>
<p>This Harp of a thousand strings, is indeed, &#8220;fearfully
and wonderfully made.&#8221; Its physics and
kinetics; its consonants and dissonants; its shifting
keyboards; its changes in pitch, rhythm, and harmony
from atom and molecule, to neurons, cells and
mass; with the tides of life&mdash;blood, plasma, water,
air, magnetism&mdash;sweeping the whole at every breath
or pulse beat, to the cry of the builder&mdash;Life&mdash;&#8220;out
with the old! in with the new!&#8221; and yet the
<i>conscious identity</i> in health, typically unchanged
and unchanging&mdash;<i>causative</i>, <i>designed</i>, <i>scientific</i>&mdash;yea
verily! and <i>purposive</i>, <i>human</i>, <i>intelligent</i>,
<i>spiritual</i>, <i>divine</i>, but a dead corpse, given over to
decomposition the moment it is bereft of that something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
we feel, and know, and name&mdash;the <i>Individual
Intelligence</i>&mdash;the Master Musician; or the staggering,
drunk, crazy fiddler, with this Harp of a thousand
strings, twanging perhaps in a mad-house!</p>
<p>Put the house in order; analyze, and classify;
adjust the furniture with the handmaids of science,
art, and beauty in evidence and at call; but for
goodness&#8217; sake! stop hypnotizing the musician&mdash;&#8220;Just
a little&#8221;&mdash;under the fallacy or the pretense of
<i>strengthening</i> the Will by <i>weakening</i> it just a little
more! This is &#8220;giving your patients fits, because
you are death on fits&#8221;! Rescue Science from this
atheromatous degeneration, and then suppress the
dabblers in &#8220;black magic&#8221; who pose as Hypnotists,
as Münsterberg advises.</p>
<p>For clear intelligence and exhaustive analysis,
Münsterberg&#8217;s &#8220;Psychotherapy&#8221; is a masterpiece,
but his psychic equation of <i>causative</i> and <i>purposive</i>,
with all his mathesis, not only remains unsolved,
but leads to confusion, from the false light shed on
the unknown quantity, and his failure to indicate
the gnosis; the demarcation between automatism
and purposive Intelligence.</p>
<p>That this confusion exists in the daily life of the
average individual whose evolution is still incomplete;
that it constitutes a large per cent. of all
cases of &#8220;dominant ideas,&#8221; obsessions, riotous emotions
and passions; that it is nowhere recognized
and defined in modern psychology, or made synthetically
clear in modern philosophy, all these lapses
make it all the more necessary that it should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
clearly defined and made plain as the basis of
Scientific Psychology.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, if Münsterberg&#8217;s conclusions
and applications are unsound because psychologically
unscientific at the point; for example,
where he almost hesitatingly indorses hypnosis,
however qualified or safeguarded, he is certain to be
quoted as authority on the subject by those who will
ignore all his qualifications to justify the practice.</p>
<p>In order to meet these imperative conditions, the
attempt to formulate any philosophy of psychology
will not be made.</p>
<p>Even were such an attempt made successfully,
that would remove the discussion from the field of
science, where it should by all means remain. What
we need is a real science of life, and this should
involve the whole mental and psychical realm, and
lead ultimately to a knowledge of the human soul.</p>
<p>Recognized facts in common experience only
need be appealed to, though different values will
have to be placed upon some of these facts as their
importance is made plain.</p>
<p>We begin with the fact of consciousness. What
it is, we do not know. What it means and does,
we know very largely and broadly. In itself, it is
purely passive. It never acts. Like space, it is the
&#8220;all container.&#8221; It is the background, the theatre
of our intelligence.</p>
<p>With the individual intelligence, plus, or with
consciousness, we have awareness. This is perception,
or cognition, still negative.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>These basic conditions, faculties and capacities,
are like a company of soldiers on parade. Now
comes the &#8220;word of command&#8221;&mdash;<i>Attention</i>!</p>
<p>Latent consciousness&mdash;awareness&mdash;now becomes
concentrated, focalized on one point, one feeling,
or emotion, or act. The soldiers &#8220;dress up,&#8221; glance
down the line, and are ready to act. Then comes
the action, the movement, the drill, or the fight.</p>
<p>The drill master is also a soldier, but he is in
command. He is called the Will. Without him and
his recognized authority, the soldiers may be a mob,
or a rabble. With him, they &#8220;fall in line,&#8221; give
&#8220;attention,&#8221; &#8220;dress up,&#8221; and are ready to act.</p>
<p>These are facts, and are basic and primary in our
conscious <i>awareness</i> and <i>attention</i> in consciousness;
the one negative, though inclusive; the other positive,
and motor, or active.</p>
<p>In his &#8220;Psychotherapy&#8221; under the heading &#8220;The
Subconscious,&#8221; Münsterberg has much to say upon
the meaning and differentiation of awareness, attention,
and recognition, but he fails to point out in
direct relation, at this point, the primary power&mdash;the
Will, moved by the Individual Intelligence.</p>
<p>Later in his work the will is recognized and
frequently referred to, but from beginning to end
he makes it incidental, rather than basic. When
he comes to broad groups of psychic phenomena, or
pathological symptoms, the sounding board of
Rational Volition is cracked and there is where
hypnosis slips in.</p>
<p>Broad as he has laid his foundations in physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and physiological synthesis, he loses sight of its
importance in the psychological; regarding as an
incident that which is a basic principle of prime
importance. Schopenhauer went, perhaps, as far
to the opposite extreme. Perhaps &#8220;the truth will
be found in the middle of the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The heir apparent, the prince regent, the lawful
Sovereign, by heredity, by the laws of Nature, and
&#8220;by the Will of God,&#8221; in this Tabernacle of Man,
is the Individual Intelligence; no matter whether
we recognize or dispute his rightful authority. His
Prime Minister is the Human Will; whether conspiring
against, or co-operating with, the King.
We may analyze the foundation of the kingdom,
and the affairs of state, and designate them as
<i>causative</i>, or <i>purposive</i>. We may see monarchy, or
anarchy; democracy or republicanism; we may dethrone
the king, and turn the state, literally, into
a mad-house; but all the facts of nature, conscious
awareness, and Scientific Psychology, cry, with one
voice, Hail to the King! Long Live the King!
I! Me! Mine! Myself! A fact so basic, that
it is as patent to the child as to the man.</p>
<p>Now comes the Juggler, the little Joker. Münsterberg
has sufficiently revealed the variety-stage,
&#8220;the Subconscious,&#8221; and his biography of the various
individual players and troupes is very elaborate.
They are, one and all, <i>Suggestions</i>. And
suggestion is the &#8220;Juggler,&#8221; and the &#8220;little
Joker.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the Intelligence and the Will, our awareness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
finds subjects and objects, ideas, images, pictures,
percepts and concepts.</p>
<p>That all these, both within and without, are
Suggestive; that one idea, or image, or object,
suggests another, or others, no one will deny, who
has ever <i>thought</i> about his own thinking. It is like
saying, all mental pictures are composite; the elements
of many kinds coming from many sources.</p>
<p>So far, <i>Suggestion</i> is all right. It is awareness
of an idea, percept, concept, or act awakened, called
to attention by another, with the question, how
does it strike you? what do you think of it? what,
if anything, do you wish, or propose to do about it?</p>
<p>It is purely negative, and suggests action or
inhibition, without the slightest domination.</p>
<p>Remember that the Will&mdash;rational Volition&mdash;is
that power, which, from the point of attention
enables the individual to act, or refuse to consider,
as he pleases.</p>
<p>If I suggest to my friend here in my library, that
it is near train time; that he can go if he chooses or
remain with me all night, he is free to act on the suggestion
and go or stay as he chooses. I have called
to his attention certain facts of time, place, or circumstance,
but left his will untrammeled. If I am
tired of him and wish him to go, or really wish him
to stay, in either case it is still a suggestion, because
I have left him free to act or not. But in
this case certain tones of my voice, not direct by
touching the will, but coloring the feelings or emotions,
color both his preferences and my own. Even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
persuasion, the power of another example, the placing
of certain views or considerations before another,
all these but make the more clear and specific the
suggestion. They reach the will through the inside,
in the realm of ideation, and not from the outside,
in the way of domination. All these things are
essential elements in social intercourse.</p>
<p>If, however, I have a motive in wishing my
friend to go, or to stay, and have determined in my
own mind which it shall be; ignoring or overriding
his own choice; and if I use my will, or passes, or
touch his eyes, or forehead, with the purpose of
concentrating <i>his</i> attention or will, on <i>my</i> wish, or
idea, or command, it is no longer free choice with
him, but domination; no longer suggestion, but
hypnosis, pure and simple.</p>
<p>The confusion and juggling at this point has been
made the sole excuse for hypnotism, through belittling
or ignoring the importance, normal action,
and supremacy of the human will.</p>
<p>No one denies that the exchange or forcible expression
of ideas, percepts, mental pictures, or concepts,
is suggestive. But the normal individual is
free to accept or reject them.</p>
<p>Education, bias, prejudice, and the like, have
also much to do in determining results.</p>
<p>But the moment you interfere with the free
choice of the individual and dominate toward your
choice, regardless of his own, you enter the realm
of hypnosis; deprive him, just to that degree, of
free choice, and might as well call it &#8220;fiddlesticks&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
as &#8220;suggestion.&#8221; It is domination, the mastery,
so far as it goes or exists at all, of the will, voluntary
powers, and sensory organs of one individual, by the
will of another; thus reversing completely the process
of nature.</p>
<p>To dominate the will of another is to weaken it.
Timidity, apprehension, fear, are in inverse ratio
to confidence, self-assurance, courage, and self-control.</p>
<p>Health, happiness, and self-development lie
along the lines of man&#8217;s higher evolution, and the
basic principle, the primary power, the minister of
state, is the rational and intelligent Will.</p>
<p>The scientific theorem of Psychology can be
nothing else than Nature&#8217;s Modulus of Man, with
its root in Universal Intelligence. Man individualizes
and involves this Intelligence as he evolves
form, function, adaptation, and adjustment, and at
least secures and maintains perfect equilibrium.</p>
<p>This is Nature&#8217;s Modulus, else the whole of human
life is purposeless and meaningless.</p>
<p>Given, then, an Individual Intelligence, endowed
with self-consciousness; with Rational Volition, the
power to choose and to act or refuse to act; how
shall it master its environment; adapt itself to any
conditions; secure adjustment and become <i>Master</i>?</p>
<p>The starting point and the keynote from first
to last is Self-Control.</p>
<p>Then come high Ideals, intelligent choice, and the
will backed by discrimination and judgment. These
lead to understanding and wisdom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>The &#8220;courage of one&#8217;s convictions,&#8221; can be
neither conceited nor blatant egotism, but a readiness
to assume full responsibility of motives, acts,
and results.</p>
<p>This recognition of Personal Responsibility is
what we call <i>Conscience</i>. It is the Judgment-seat
of the Individual Intelligence in the Kingdom of its
own Soul, or realm of consciousness. The moment
this throne totters, or is obscured, devolution begins,
and degeneration, insanity, and Inferno lie that way.</p>
<p>It does not change one principle involved, or
weaken either Modulus or Theorem when we reflect
that most equations are ended by death, long before
being brought to successful solution. For the
time they are certainly interrupted.</p>
<p>Neither do the babel of tongues, the theories,
theologies, or philosophies change either Modulus
or Theorem, because they are grounded in demonstrated
facts, recognized, either vaguely or clearly,
in the conscious experience of every intelligent
thinking man and woman.</p>
<p>Constructive Psychology, based upon Science, for
the building of character by persistent effort, increasing
continually all personal resources, means
the normal higher evolution of man.</p>
<p>So-called religions and the life after death have
been purposely left unconsidered.</p>
<p>If we really have a Science of the Soul&mdash;the Individual
Intelligence&mdash;based upon psychological
facts, demonstrated in the daily experience of every
healthy individual, it touches religion at its most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
vital point, viz.: ethics or morals. If these ethical
principles are true and demonstrable, they must
constitute the foundation of religion as of ethics.
If morals are strengthened and made clear, and
Personal Responsibility as Conscience, is recognized
and accepted, the Vicarious Atonement will have
to go, and Theologians will have to change their
mystical and miraculous interpretations from Vicarious
Atonement to personal at-one-ment with
<i>Christos</i>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;miraculous conception,&#8221; and &#8220;virgin birth,&#8221;
held equally in regard to Christna centuries before,
and also the literal resurrection of the physical
body will have to be otherwise explained.</p>
<p>The purposive view as one full term of the
psychological equation, will find uniform law and
order in place of the credulous legends of ignorant
and superstitious monks, while the Divine Man will
be taken down from the cross and restored to the
heart of humanity, as the Modulus of Nature,
<i>realized</i> as a normal evolution, under natural and
spiritual law.</p>
<p>Salvation from sin, ignorance, superstition, and
fear, will be recognized as the result of &#8220;Leading
the Life,&#8221; and Vicarious only through a divine
example; or, if you please, <i>legitimate Suggestion</i>;
with personal effort, rational volition, and personal
responsibility working in harmony toward the desired
result.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO ANCIENT INDIA</h3>
</div>

<p>It is more than thirty years since in Southern
Europe, England, and America, a genuine
Renaissance of Vedic literature, philosophy, and
religion began to assume a popular form and to
become accessible to the general reading public.</p>
<p>Scholars, like Sir William Jones, had for the
past century been familiar with the ancient civilization
and the Vedic literature and the study of Sanscrit
had made some progress in the Universities.</p>
<p>The idea, however, that these antiquities had any
vital interest to us, beyond curious myths and obsolete
superstitions, had not been perceived, much less
admitted.</p>
<p>The antiquity of man, and the Philosophy of
Evolution, had opened new fields for thought, and
necessitated a revision of all previous concepts of
man and nature.</p>
<p>Old records and interpretations were everywhere
revised, and the interpretations of the Mosaic
records were challenged at every point.</p>
<p>Popular religions were up in arms and were
compelled to adjust themselves to the new régime.</p>
<p>But even after this century of progress and enlightenment,
it has scarcely yet dawned on the mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
of theologians that the challenge of science was,
after all, insignificant, compared with that which
was to come, and for which modern science had
paved the way.</p>
<p>The whole realm of theology, and the foundations
of religion, were to undergo revision.</p>
<p>Facts incontestable were being gathered and proofs
established beyond all possible denial, or controversy,
that all modern theologies and religions were copied
and adapted from Vedic and ante-Vedic sources,
antedating our present era by more than two
thousand years.</p>
<p>The superficial and devout churchman, whose
faith is fortified on the one hand by superstition, and
on the other at least borders on fanaticism, is apt
to be resentful in the presence of these facts, and,
falling back on the infallibility and plenary inspiration
of the Bible, to declare that if his own superficial
interpretations are questioned or denied, Religion
will be done for and mankind left in utter
darkness.</p>
<p>He does not perceive that the facts of nature
and the essentials of religion are one thing, and
man&#8217;s <i>interpretation</i> of them another thing entirely.</p>
<p>He does not perceive how these ignorant and
superstitious interpretations of men have set at
naught the real life of Jesus and the teachings of
the Christ.</p>
<p>He does not realize how doctrine has usurped
the place of duty, and dogmatism has hardened
the soul of man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>One thing, however, is inevitable. Facts and
evidence as to origin, analogies, and adaptation
of the Christian Mysteries from ancient India,
are widely known, and the time has come
when these mysteries are being examined as to
their intrinsic meaning and their bearing on the
daily life of man and the progress of the human
race.</p>
<p>The author of this little book has only attempted
a bare outline of these great facts, and to put them
in such shape that the reader may perceive their
general bearing, and the sources whence they are
derived.</p>
<p>The following extracts made almost at random,
the quantity of evidence being so redundant, from
Jacolliot&#8217;s &#8220;Bible in India,&#8221; a translation of which
was made in this country as early as 1873, and Prof.
Max Müller&#8217;s Lectures, &#8220;India, What Can It Teach
Us?&#8221; printed here more than a quarter of a century
ago, will give the reader the evidence and the
assurance that these ancient sources of wisdom are
scarcely yet known in outline to the Western
World.</p>
<p>Jacolliot spent many years in India, studying its
present civilization and its ancient lore, while Prof.
Max Müller derived his knowledge largely from
study of Sanscrit and the Vedanta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soil of Ancient India, cradle of humanity, hail!
Hail, venerable and efficient nurse, whom centuries
of brutal invasion have not yet buried under the dust
of oblivion! Hail, fatherland of faith, of love, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
poetry, and of science. May we hail a revival of thy
past in our Western future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have dwelt &#8217;midst the depths of your mysterious
forests, seeking to comprehend the language of your
lofty nature, and the evening airs that murmured
&#8217;midst the foliage of banyans and tamarinds whispered
to my spirit these three magic words: Zeus,
Jehovah, Brahma.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have inquired of Brahmins and priests under
the porches of temples and ancient pagodas, and
they have replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To live is to think, and to think is to study
God, who is all, and in all....</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To live is to learn, to learn is to examine and
to fathom in all their perceptible forms the innumerable
manifestations of celestial power.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To live is to be useful; to live is to be just;
and we learn to be useful and just in studying this
book of the Vedas, which is the word of eternal
wisdom, the principle of principles as revealed to
our fathers.&#8217;&#8221; (&#8220;The Bible in India,&#8221; p. 15.)</p>
<p>Plotinus, the Neoplatonist, said: &#8220;God is not the
principal of beings, but the principle of principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the Hindoo concept of <i>Para Brahm</i>
two thousand years before.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the whole world there is no study so beneficial
and so elevating as that of the Upanishads.
It has been the solace of my life&mdash;it will be the
solace of my death. [Schopenhauer, quoted by
Max Müller.] ... If I were to look over the
whole world to find out the country most richly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that
nature can bestow&mdash;in some parts a very paradise
on earth&mdash;I should point to India. If I were
asked under what sky the human mind had most
fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most
deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life,
and has found solutions of some of them which well
deserve the attention even of those who have studied
Plato and Kant&mdash;I should point to India. And if
I were to ask myself from what literature we, here
in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively
on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans,
and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw
that corrective which is most wanted in order to
make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive,
more universal, in fact more truly human,
a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and
eternal life&mdash;again I should point to India.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reader should remember that this is not the
<i>opinion</i> of an ignorant enthusiast, but the mature
judgment of one of the most profound scholars
and Sanscritists in Europe in his day&mdash;Prof. Max
Müller.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study of Mythology has assumed an
entirely new character, chiefly owing to the light
that has been thrown on it by the ancient Vedic
Mythology of India.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddhism is now known to have been the
principal source of our legends and parables.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story of the two women who claimed each
to be the mother of the same child is found literally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
in the Kanjur, translated from the Buddhist Tripitake,
and the &#8220;Judgment of Solomon&#8221; is only a
copy of the older story.</p>
<p>&#8220;The history of all histories, and yet the mystery
of all mysteries&mdash;take religion, and where can you
study its true origin, its natural growth and its
inevitable decay better than in India, the home of
Brahmanism, the birthplace of Buddhism, and the
refuge of Zoroastrianism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take any of the burning questions of the day&mdash;popular
education, higher education, parliamentary
representation, codification of laws, finance, emigration,
poor-law, and whether you have anything to
teach and to try, or anything to observe and to learn,
India will supply you with a laboratory such as
exists nowhere else.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in the study of the history of the human
mind, and the study of ourselves, of our true selves,
India occupies a place second to no other country.
Whatever sphere of the human mind you may select
for your special study, whether it be language, or
religion, or mythology, or philosophy, whether it
be laws or customs, primitive art or primitive
science, everywhere, you have to go to India,
whether you like it or not, because some of the
most valuable and most instructive materials in the
history of man are treasured up in India, and in
India only.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleeman tells us men (in India) adhere habitually
and religiously to the truth, and &#8216;I have had
before me hundreds of cases,&#8217; he says, &#8216;in which a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
man&#8217;s property, liberty, and life have depended
upon his telling a lie, and he has refused to tell it.&#8217;
Could many an English judge say the same?&#8221;
(Remarks by Prof. Müller.)</p>
<p>Prof. Müller quotes from an Arabian writer of
the thirteenth century, &#8220;The Indians are innumerable,
like grains of sand, free from all deceit and
violence. They fear neither death nor life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And again, from Marco Polo, in the thirteenth
century, &#8220;You must know, Marco Polo says, that
these Abralaman (Hindoos) are the best merchants
in the world, and the most truthful, for they would
not tell a lie for anything on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the sixteenth century Abu Fazl, the minister
of the Emperor Akbar, says in his &#8216;Ayin Akbari,&#8217;
&#8216;The Hindus are religious, affable, cheerful, lovers
of justice, given to retirement, able in business, admirers
of truth, grateful and of unbounded fidelity,
and their soldiers know not what it is to fly from
the field of battle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>(How badly these &#8220;poor heathen&#8221; were in need
of the Jesuit missionary, and the British government
and civilization!)</p>
<p>Prof. Müller quotes Warren Hastings regarding
the Hindus in general, as follows, &#8220;They are gentle
and benevolent, more susceptible of gratitude for
kindness shown them, and less prompted to vengeance
for wrongs inflicted, than any people on
the face of the earth&mdash;faithful, affectionate, submissive
to legal authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bishop Heber said, &#8220;The Hindus are brave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
courteous, intelligent, most eager for knowledge and
improvement, sober, industrious, dutiful to parents,
affectionate to their children, uniformly gentle and
patient, and more easily affected by kindness and
attention to their wants and feelings than any
people I ever met with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elphinstone said, &#8220;No set of people among the
Hindus are so depraved as the dregs of our own
great towns.&#8221; (It might have been wiser to have
employed English missionaries at home.)</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Munro bears even stronger testimony.
He writes, &#8220;If a good system of agriculture, unrivaled
manufacturing-skill, a capacity to produce
whatever can contribute to either convenience or luxury,
schools established in every village for teaching
reading, writing and arithmetic, the general practice
of hospitality, and charity among each other,
and above all, a treatment of the female sex full
of confidence, respect, and delicacy, are among the
signs which denote a civilized people&mdash;then the
Hindus are not inferior to the nations of Europe&mdash;and
if civilization is to become an article of trade
between England and India, <i>I am convinced that
England will gain by the import cargo</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even at the present moment, after a century
of English rule and English teaching, I believe
that Sanskrit is more widely understood in India,
than Latin was in Europe at the time of Dante.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are thousands of Brahmans, even now,
when so little inducement exists for Vedic studies,
who know the whole of the Rig-Veda by heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
and can repeat it, and what applies to the Rig-Veda,
applies to many other books.&#8221; (Ten thousand and
seventeen hymns.)</p>
<p>Speaking of other and later literature, Prof.
Müller says, &#8220;It is different with the ancient literature
of India, the literature dominated by the Vedic
and Buddhistic religions. That literature opens to
us a chapter in what has been called the Education
OF THE HUMAN RACE, TO WHICH WE CAN FIND NO PARALLEL
anywhere else. Whoever cares for the historical
growth of our language, that is, of our thoughts;
whoever cares for the intelligible development of
religion and mythology, whoever cares for the first
foundation of what in later times we call the sciences
of astronomy, metronomy, grammar and etymology;
whoever cares for the first intimations of philosophical
thought; for the first attempts at regulating
family life, village life, and state life, as founded
on religion, ceremonial, tradition and contact
(Samaya), must in future pay the same attention
to the literature of the Vedic period as to the literature
of Greece and Rome and Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;I maintain then that for a study of man, or, if
you like, for a study of Aryan humanity, there is
nothing in the world equal in importance with the
Veda.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aristocracy of those who know&mdash;<i>di color
che sanno</i>&mdash;or try to know, is open to all who are
willing to enter, to all who have a feeling for the
past; an interest in the genealogy of our thoughts,
and a reverence for the ancestry of our intellect, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
are, in fact, historians in the true sense of the word,
i.e. inquirers into that which is past, but not lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we mean by primitive the people who
have been the first of the Aryan race to leave behind
literary relics of their existence on earth,
then I say the Vedic poets are primitive; the
Vedic language is primitive; the Vedic religion is
primitive, and, taken as a whole, <i>more primitive
than anything else that we are ever likely to recover
in the whole history of our race</i>....</p>
<p>&#8220;For this reason, because the religion of the
Veda was so completely guarded from all strange
infection, it is full of lessons which the student of
religion could learn nowhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foregoing quotations have been made from a
little volume, &#8220;India: What Can It Teach Us?&#8221;
published by Funk and Wagnalls in 1883, and sold
at 25 cents, so that these statements of Prof. Max
Müller have been accessible for more than a quarter
of a century.</p>
<p>Since 1883, however, we have heard more and
more of the &#8220;Wisdom of Old India.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole Theosophical movement, degenerate as
it may have become in some directions, and much
as it has been misinterpreted, and ridiculed and
exploited in others, was primarily a sincere and
earnest attempt &#8220;to bring the Secret Doctrine of
ancient India within reach of Western students,&#8221; to
promote the brotherhood of man; the study of ancient
philosophy and the psychical powers latent in
man. There are thousands of intelligent and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
earnest students all over the world who have been
uplifted, illuminated, and encouraged by these
studies. When the true history of the present epoch
comes to be written, there can be no shadow of
doubt as to the recognition that will be accorded to
H. P. Blavatsky and her aims, her life, and her
work.</p>
<p>But such movements as are going on in the
world, continually change their base, their methods,
and their prospective. While the new awakening
unmistakably goes back to old India, and compels a
review and a readjustment of all our knowledge,
and all our hopes and aims, another spirit has
entered our intellectual realm, and compelled attention
and recognition.</p>
<p>It has made for itself a habitation and a name,
and nothing less than a cataclysm can altogether
overthrow it.</p>
<p>It is the Genius of Scientific Criticism, Research,
and Demonstration.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Mistakes of Moses&#8221; may indeed be paralleled
by those of modern physical science, and these
are being revealed side by side with those of theology
and dogmatic assertion.</p>
<p>It has hardly yet dawned upon the mind of the
physical scientist that the concept of the psychical
and spiritual life and nature of man comprises,
with the world of matter and form, a complete
theorem of human life. He is often as incredulous,
resentful, and contemptuous as the creed-bound
religionist at the approach of more light, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
suggestion that all these essential problems were
included and solved ages ago in ancient Aryavarta;
and that &#8220;the few who know,&#8221; the ancient order
of the <i>Illuminati</i>, now designated the &#8220;School of
Natural Science,&#8221; has treasured this knowledge for
ages.</p>
<p>The Vedas are not only ancient, but complicated
and diffuse, and the busy life of the modern student
will hardly suffice for the mastery of their wisdom,
or the understanding of their secrets.</p>
<p>When, however, this ancient wisdom is condensed
and epitomized, in perfect harmony with the concepts,
the methods, and the demonstrations of
Natural Science, the &#8220;Jewel in the Lotus,&#8221;&mdash;to use
a Vedic synonym,&mdash;will appear in all its beauty and
glory, to all who have eyes to see, and ears to
hear, with determination to &#8220;honor every truth by
use,&#8221; and loyal service.</p>
<p>In the foregoing quotations it may be seen what
this real knowledge did for the people of ancient
India in building character on constructive lines,
promoting justice, equity, charity, and kindness
among the common people, and the teeming millions
of India, when our Saxon and Norman ancestors
were still barbarians, and before the Jew or the
Christian were even dreamed of.</p>
<p>In the following quotations from Jacolliot&#8217;s
&#8220;Bible in India,&#8221; an outline will be given as to the
source of some of our myths, pantheons, and
religions.</p>
<p>These brief and imperfect outlines from two small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and generally forgotten books, ought to satisfy any
intelligent and unbiased student how completely the
general thesis may be demonstrated from the ancient
records themselves.</p>
<p>The books from which these quotations are made
are like kindergarten primers for the use of beginners.</p>
<p>The present writer&#8217;s interest in and study of
Theosophy and the Secret Doctrine were instigated
by Schopenhauer&#8217;s &#8220;World as Will and Idea.&#8221;
He found how largely Schopenhauer had drawn
from the Upanishads (see previous quotation), and
how little, after all, his &#8220;Philosophy&#8221; had utilized
the ancient Wisdom. Hence he resolved to seek
the ancient sources of knowledge, and has been trying
his best to apprehend and utilize them, the
hoarded wisdom of the ages.</p>
<p>He is not in the least anxious to gain recognition
for, or to seek to rehabilitate old India, for its own
sake. She speaks for herself, through the centuries
of the past, and will continue to speak and to influence
all coming time.</p>
<p>Jacolliot shows, however, a little irritation at this
point over the suppression of facts, the brutality of
marauding invaders, and the wholesale and brazen
appropriation without the least credit to India&#8217;s
store of wisdom.</p>
<p>The present writer is, however, exceedingly
desirous that his fellow-students in the West should
discover, recognize, and utilize this ancient mine of
wisdom for themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>Its day of recognition is just now at the dawn,
and the most pressing problems concerning the real
nature, the spiritual possibilities, and the eternal
destiny of the soul of man, are pressing and burning
questions to-day.</p>
<p>That these problems do not wait solution by
modern physical science and physio-psychology, but
await only the understanding and acceptance of
every earnest and intelligent student, is easily
demonstrated. It challenges the world to-day, as
it has not done before for many millenniums, and
the issues are to be tried out to a scientific demonstration.</p>
<p>The preferences and prejudices of partisans will
not be consulted, nor will they in the least interrupt
the progress, nor interfere with the solution.</p>
<p>The question is no longer, &#8220;What think ye of
Jesus?&#8221; but &#8220;What <i>know</i> ye of your own
soul?&#8221; A new faith will supersede the old superstitions.</p>
<p>Faith, from the viewpoint of Natural Science, is
&#8220;the soul&#8217;s intuitive <i>conviction</i> of that which both
reason and conscience approve.&#8221; Blind faith, or
belief, is ever the handmaid of superstition. The
new faith is the harbinger, the promise, and the
potency of knowledge, the anchor of the soul, and
the armor of righteousness.</p>
<p>This is indeed the language of confidence, and it
should be put to the test of science and experience.</p>
<p>The scornful and the contemptuous are not even
<i>invited</i>! They are left alone with their Idols.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Coming now more directly to the splendid work
of Jacolliot, one thing I think ought to be apparent
to every honest and intelligent reader of &#8220;The
Bible in India,&#8221; and that is, that its author is in
no sense a partisan of Hinduism, but a searcher
and witness for the simple Truth as he finds and
apprehends it.</p>
<p>He puts aside mystery, miracle, and Divine
Revelation, as dispassionately in the Vedic, Brahmanical,
and Buddhistic cults, as in the Mosaic and
Christian. Belief in God, and reverence for Truth
in the light of reason and conscience, shine from
every page of his work.</p>
<p>To flippantly call him an &#8220;atheist,&#8221; or a &#8220;destroyer
of holy things,&#8221; as though that were in any
sense an answer to his thesis, and which formerly
was the rule, and may even now be attempted in
certain quarters, will simply brand the bigot as
by no means intelligent&mdash;if indeed honest&mdash;who attempts
it. The majority of such sectarians have
grown wise or prudent enough to ignore all such
issues.</p>
<p>There has been a great change in public sentiment
since Jacolliot went to India as an earnest
student of these subjects, and in the nearly forty
years since he wrote this book.</p>
<p>The saying that &#8220;Truth passes through three
phases before being accepted,&#8221; specially applies
here. First, people say, &#8220;It is not true.&#8221; Second,
&#8220;It contradicts Scripture,&#8221; and when it at last is
triumphant, that &#8220;<i>Everybody knew it before</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>The truths of which Jacolliot writes have already
reached at least the beginning of the third stage.
Of course, &#8220;Everybody&#8221; here means those who
read, and think, and dare to use conscience and
reason.</p>
<p>In referring to a religious debate between a missionary
and a Brahman, and the universal interest
manifested among all classes as to the outcome of
the encounter, &#8220;hooting the vanquished in either
case with strict impartiality,&#8221; Jacolliot adds, &#8220;We
shall be less surprised at this when it is known
that there is not a Hindoo, whatever his rank or
caste, who does not know the principles of the
Holy Scripture, that is, the Vedas, and who does
not <i>perfectly know how to read and write</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three hundred and forty millions of people,
thousands of them pariahs and outcasts, sharing
refuse with the dogs, with no rights that any one
else is bound to respect, bowing their faces in the
dust when a Brahman passes ten paces away&mdash;and
yet everyone can read and write!</p>
<p>Max Müller said he had had in his study at
Oxford a young Hindoo who could repeat the whole
of the Mahabharata <i>without missing a word or an
inflection</i> from beginning to end.</p>
<p>These are some of the <i>remnants</i> in the decline of
old India after thousands of years of Brahman rule
and slavish domination of the people to preserve
their own exclusive caste and exploitation. Western
people have yet to learn the inevitable tendency,
and the invariable rule of exploitation of the people,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
by a dominant priesthood, and the poverty and
degradation of the masses that always results.
It has never once failed in this result in three
thousand years.</p>
<p>The whole of Southern Europe is already awakening
to a realization of this result to-day. It is
accomplished in the name of &#8220;Religion&#8221; by those
who call themselves &#8220;Viceregents of God,&#8221; and
who arrogantly trample on the rights of conscience,
and the freedom of man.</p>
<p>Brahmanism first set the example as originators
of this slavish abomination.</p>
<p>The studies and investigations of Jacolliot in
India, go back to the Vedic or pre-Brahmanic age;
then to the rise, development, and slow decline of
Brahmanism; then the epoch of Christna; the influence
of Buddha, and his being driven out of
India by the powerful Brahmans; and finally, to
the present poverty and degradation of the millions
through foreign invasion and domination.</p>
<p>The ruling Brahmans had neither thought nor
desire for <i>Constructive Nationality</i>. In their pride
and lust for power and gold, even in their just
pride over their inheritance from Vedic ancestors,
and wisdom, Patriotism was unknown to them.
Invaders contended with them in robbing and enslaving
the people.</p>
<p>The people who despised and hated the foreign
invader dare not, even yet, to rise against their
real despoilers&mdash;the Brahmans&mdash;or defy or break
their power.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>It is the Vedic literature, and the earliest, or
pre-Brahmanic time that Jacolliot lauds so highly,
and in which he finds and demonstrates, the existence
of the sources of all human knowledge.</p>
<p>It will be ignorant folly, therefore, for the bigot
and the sectarian to attempt to answer or oppose
him, by referring to the condition of the people
of India as it is to-day.</p>
<p>Jacolliot simply shows the causes that have led
to the present degradation.</p>
<p>It is <i>priestcraft</i>, despite the Vedic wisdom, and
the missions and teaching of Christna and Buddha.</p>
<p>All this Jacolliot demonstrates beyond all controversy.</p>
<p>The bulk of his work consists in demonstrating
the source of Greek and Roman Mythology, Language,
Law, Philosophy, etc., and equally of every
Jewish and Christian doctrine and tradition.</p>
<p>Jacolliot shows that as the French code is copied
or adapted from the Justinian, so equally the Justinian
was derived from that of Manu, many centuries
previously. And what is true of Law is
equally true of philosophy, theology, morals, and the
principles of science, art, architecture, and all the
rest.</p>
<p>The Hindoos were demoralized by the priests, but
the moral degradation extended even to them, and
the arms they employed were turned against
themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first result of the baneful domination of
priests in India was the abasement and moral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
degradation of woman, so respected and honored
during the Vedic period.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would reign over the persons of slaves,
over brutalized intelligence, the history of these infamous
epochs presents a means of unequaled simplicity.
<i>Degrade and demoralize the woman</i>, and
you will soon have made of man a debased creature,
without energy to struggle against the darkest
despotisms; for, according to the fine expression
of the Vedas, &#8216;the woman is the soul of humanity.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>As did the Brahman priesthood, when through
greed and ambition they forsook the ancient wisdom,
so do the priesthood of Rome, with their
celibacy added to the abominations and opportunities
of the confessional.</p>
<p>Search the records of all time, and the traditions
and customs of every people, and you will find
nowhere else such recognition and reverence paid
to woman as in the early Vedic days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it be well understood,&#8221; says Jacolliot, &#8220;that
it was but sacerdotal influence and Brahminical
decay that, in changing the primitive condition of
the East, reduced woman to a state of subordination
which has not yet disappeared from our social
system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us read these maxims taken at hazard from
the sacred books of India.&#8221; (I quote only a few.)
&#8220;Man is strength&mdash;woman is beauty; he is the
reason that governs, but she is the wisdom that
moderates; the one cannot exist without the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
and hence the Lord created them two, for the one
purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;He who despises woman, despises his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is cursed by a woman, is cursed by God.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tears of woman call down the fire of heaven
on those who make them flow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The songs of women are sweet in the ears of
the Lord; men should not, if they wish to be heard,
sing the praise of God without women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women should be protected with tenderness,
and gratified with gifts, by all who wish for length
of days.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was at the prayer of a woman that the
Creator pardoned man; cursed be he who forgets
it.&#8221; (See the Vedic &#8220;Garden of Eden.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Moses, trained only in the decay of the old
religion by the degenerate priests of Egypt, while
drawing his legend of creation from the ancient
Vedic source, reverses all this and places the blame
of the &#8220;Fall&#8221; on woman, and the women of the
Bible are more often concubines and prostitutes
than Love&#8217;s pure evangels as in the ancient days.
Jacolliot proves this from many citations, as witness
also the following: (Numbers, Chapter XXI.)</p>
<p>&#8220;And Moses was enraged against the chief officers
of the army, against the tribunes, and the centurions
who returned from battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he said unto them, Why have you saved
the women and the children?</p>
<p>&#8220;Slay therefore all the males amongst the children,
and the women who have been married.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But reserve for yourselves all the young girls
who are still virgins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moses spoke &#8220;in the name of God,&#8221; as does his
Holiness at Rome to-day. Comment is hardly
necessary. A few more quotations from the Vedas:</p>
<p>&#8220;A virtuous woman needs no purification, for
she is never defiled, even by contact with impurity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women should be shielded by fostering solicitude
by their fathers, their brothers, their husbands,
and the brothers of their husbands, if they hope
for great prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;When women are honored, the divinities are
content, but where they are not honored, all undertakings
fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sacerdotal caste in Egypt followed the inspiration
of the Brahmans, and took care to make
no change in that situation.</p>
<p>And Moses followed the example of the priests
of Egypt, where woman was a slave or a prostitute
in the temples as out.</p>
<p>The degeneracy of a people, the decay of religion,
and the degradation of woman are inseparable, and
it is so-called &#8220;religion&#8221; that institutes the change,
and sets the pace, &#8220;down the steep descent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Brahmans &#8220;forgot God&#8221; and instituted the
worship of saints and holy men, and mythological
characters, just as Rome does to-day. The women
of America to-day by a consensus of public opinion
should make auricular confession <i>disreputable</i>.</p>
<p>Excommunication, which is such a power in the
hands of Rome, is merely a subterfuge and substitute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
for the degradation of &#8220;outcasts,&#8221; and pariahs,
instituted by the Brahman priests to terrify the
disobedient and retain their power.</p>
<p>If the reader cares to know the danger and the
degradation to woman fostered and protected
through the Confessional by the Celibate Roman
priesthood, he should read &#8220;The History of Auricular
Confession,&#8221; by De Lasteyrie, translated into
English and printed in London in 1848. Now and
then a Pope or a council undertook to institute reform,
but found, as in Spain, prostitution of women
by priests through the confessional so widespread
and universal that they more often gave up the
attempt through fear of scandal and contempt for
the Church itself.</p>
<p>Lecky, in his &#8220;History of European Morals,&#8221;
records the case of &#8220;the abbot-elect of St. Augustine,
at Canterbury, who in 1171 was found on investigation
to have <i>seventeen illegitimate children in a
single village</i>; or, an abbot of St. Pelayo, in Spain,
who in 1130 was proved to have kept no less than
seventy concubines; or Henry III, Bishop of Liège,
who was deposed in 1274 for having sixty-five
illegitimate children.&#8221; (History of European Morals.
P. 350.)</p>
<p>If the reader remarks that &#8220;this is ancient history,&#8221;
he should remember that a celibate priesthood
to-day have the same opportunity, through
the secrecy and power of the Confessional, as ever.</p>
<p>I have barely touched on this disgusting but all-important
question on the general thesis of Jacolliot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
viz.: &#8220;The first result of the baneful domination of
priests in India was the abasement and moral
degradation of woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rome, who derived her religious code from
paganized Egypt, added celibacy to the opportunities
and inducements for the degradation of
woman. Rome never attained the heights from
which the Brahman priesthood plunged into debauchery.
Even to-day in the festivals in the
Brahman temples wholesale orgies of prostitution
are sometimes found, as witnessed and recorded by
Jacolliot. From the first, Brahman priests have
married and reared families. Their degradation
and debauchery, therefore, cannot be charged to
their original &#8220;Divine Revelation,&#8221; but to their
corruption of it.</p>
<p>I have given a few brief quotations among hundreds
recorded by Jacolliot as to the respect and
veneration accorded to woman in early Vedic times,
and in the Laws of Manu.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Brahman may not approach the altar of
sacrifice <i>but with a soul pure, in a body undefiled</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirituous liquors beget drunkenness, neglect of
duty, and they profane prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The antiquity of India stands forth to establish
its priority of religious legislation in prohibiting to
priests the use of spirituous liquors, and especially
in forbidding the pleasures of love when they are
about to offer sacrifice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman whose words and thoughts and person
are pure is a celestial balm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Happy shall he be whose choice is approved by
all the good.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ordained that a devotee shall choose a wife
from his own class.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Brahman who marries a woman who is not a
virgin, who is a widow, or divorced by her husband,
or who is not known as a virtuous woman, cannot be
permitted to offer sacrifice, for he is impure, and
nothing can cleanse him from his impurities.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jacolliot adds, &#8220;It is not recorded, says
the divine Manu, that a Brahman has ever, even by
compulsion, married a girl of low class.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the Brahman espouse a Brahmine, says
the Veda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him take a well-formed virgin, of an agreeable
name, of the graceful carriage of the swan,
or of the young elephant, whose body is covered with
light down, her hair fine, her teeth small, and her
limbs charmingly graceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacolliot compares these early Vedic injunctions
with Leviticus, Chapter XXI, and the absurdities
introduced by Moses as to a &#8220;crooked nose or a
squint eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woman here in the West is just emerging from
the slavery and degradation of ages, and she <i>ought</i>
to know that that degradation was not the handicap
of barbaric and undeveloped races, so far as the
Aryan race is concerned, but a demoralization and
degradation instituted by priests, in the name of
religion, through which they have sought to rule the
world, and so far as institutional religions are concerned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
woman has had to progress <i>in spite of
them</i>.</p>
<p>Without the aid and influence of woman to-day,
neither Protestant nor Roman Church could exist
at all, as witness almost any Sabbath service where
women outnumber men often ten to one.</p>
<p>One day woman will be wise enough and brave
enough to dictate terms, as she did ages ago in old
Aryavarta. When that day comes, and the really
Divine Motherhood planted in every true woman&#8217;s
soul is recognized by man and woman alike, God
grant that she may thenceforth hold the fort till the
Kali-Yuga is at full tide, and the Spiritual Evolution
of our present Humanity is fully accomplished.</p>
<p>In the meantime the world will have learned to
<i>know</i> Jesus, who and what he was, and how he
became the Christ, and will have joined in his
Divine Mission to man, as the teeming millions
joined in old India under Christna ages ago.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>HERO WORSHIP AND FOLKLORE</h3>
</div>

<p>The history of every people, of all time, and
of every religion of which we have any record,
reveals a similar origin, course, and destiny.</p>
<p>We of the present day have the advantage of
these records upon which to institute comparisons,
ascertain relations, and draw conclusions.</p>
<p>True, the partisans and postulants of all these
religions at the present day will claim exception
in favor of their own cult, and regard as sacrilegious
and profane any attempt to institute comparisons
and draw general conclusions.</p>
<p>Any attempt to persuade them of their error
would be useless.</p>
<p>The essentials of their religion will not be called
in question, but on the other hand, they will find
that it is impossible to escape from the habitual
and universal tendencies in which they are involved.</p>
<p>However veritable may have been the original
revelations, the tendencies and habits of weaving
around them the traditions and superstitions of
folklore seem to have been inevitable and universal.</p>
<p>It is the province of Science to ascertain the facts
in any given case, to institute comparisons, and to
draw deductions and generalizations dispassionately
and relentlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>It is thus that every tradition, superstition, creed,
dogma, and revelation comes under review, and is
placed on trial.</p>
<p>True science has no preconceived notion, no foregone
conclusion. Each subject examined must tell
its own story and in its own way, and stand or fall
measured by intrinsic evidence and revealed fact.</p>
<p>To this tribunal every episode in the life of man
and the history of the human race must at last
come.</p>
<p>What are the <i>facts</i>? What do they reveal and
signify?</p>
<p>To most religionists this method and aim of
science seem as relentless and dogmatic as their own
creed or dogmas.</p>
<p>It is a sifting and discriminative process, that,
while relentless, is in the end eminently Just, and
in the end will be found to be the revealer of all
that is essential and true in religion itself.</p>
<p>In itself, science is not and never can be a religion.</p>
<p>It is a <i>method</i> only, which, like a search-light,
reveals all religions in all their essentials, and
places them in their true light.</p>
<p>Religion <i>per se</i> is an essential element in the
nature and life of man and of the human race.</p>
<p>Science is a method, a way of procedure in the
intelligent mind of man in its search for truth.</p>
<p>Religion is vital, essential, basic. It is born of the
relation which inheres in the kinship of the individual
intelligence to the Universal Spirit of Nature and of
all life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Science is the intelligent and rational use of the
mental powers of man.</p>
<p>Religion is intuitional, spiritual perception, involving
the heart, the affections. Man aspires,
worships, adores, and by the light of Faith or
intuitive conviction, recognizes that which he cannot
explain and cannot get rid of if he tries.</p>
<p>Science is the just weight and measure of things
seen, and of the natural causes of phenomena.</p>
<p>Religion&mdash;the evidence of things unseen. Religion,
as a <i>fact</i>, can never be explained away by
Science.</p>
<p>The so-called science that assumes or undertakes
to do that, is materialism and nescience.</p>
<p>Superstition is the false interpretation of religion,
and folklore and tradition are the accretions
that gather around the foundations and original
revelations of religion, and lead at last to obscuration
and the need of a new revelation.</p>
<p>Each genuine new &#8220;revelation&#8221; is but the rehabilitation
of the primeval religion in which accretions,
false interpretations, and dogmatic assertions
are cast aside.</p>
<p>Religion represents man&#8217;s endeavor to apprehend
and interpret the unseen; that &#8220;something
more&#8221; and &#8220;something beyond&#8221; the visible, the
sensuous, and the tangible.</p>
<p>It is this conscious <i>awareness</i> of something more
and something beyond the visible and the tangible,
that furnishes man with a conception of God and
of the human soul. This is a natural intuition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
inseparable from the <i>awareness</i> of self. It lies at
the foundation like man&#8217;s self-conscious identity, and
can neither be explained nor explained away.</p>
<p>Here lies the root of all religions. The imagery
of man&#8217;s imagination, in his effort to apprehend the
unseen, and to formulate the unknown, gives rise
to myths, allegory, tradition, folklore, and in the
end, to superstition, creed, and dogma.</p>
<p>Then come priestcraft, oppression, persecution.
The death of religion, the deification of the revealer
or <i>Avatar</i>, and the substitution of the priesthood
as of divine authority, in place of the <i>revealer</i> or the
revelation.</p>
<p>Jove, Orpheus, Jehovah, and at last Jesus, are
enthroned beyond the clouds, and priest or church
assume the earthly prerogative, speak in their place,
assume dogmatic authority, promise heaven and
happiness for obedience, and dire penalties for disobedience,
and resort to persecution to maintain
their authority.</p>
<p>The traditions, mythologies, and folklore of all
the past have thus arisen. The creeds and dogmas
of the present constitute the effort of man to assume
exclusive dominion, and to exercise divine authority
over the masses of mankind. It is only another
form of the ambition of individuals for wealth, fame
or power, lifting them to a &#8220;class&#8221; above the toiling,
suffering, and sorrowing masses.</p>
<p>There are exceptional individuals all along the
way, who conceive, hold, and exercise the spirit of
the Master, and sink self in the service of man, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
but for these the organized priesthood would be
execrated by mankind long before.</p>
<p>The organized church deifies, where the true
disciple humanizes and helps mankind in the name
and in the spirit of the Master.</p>
<p>This is the spirit, the origin, the genius and the
history of every Avatar, of Christna, and all the
Buddhas, the Saviors and Redeemers of history.</p>
<p>The orthodox Christian of to-day, whether Catholic
or Protestant, will be likely to admit the foregoing
outline except as it applies to his own religion.
Whereas it is abundantly proven to-day regarding
his own religion as nowhere else in history.</p>
<p>The histories of former religions are vague, distant,
and so covered over by tradition, myth, and
folklore, as to be difficult to trace.</p>
<p>The beginnings, history, and progress of the
Christian religion are comparatively nearer at hand,
and the process above outlined readily demonstrable.</p>
<p>Not only so, but the recognition of the facts and
processes is everywhere in evidence.</p>
<p>This fact, however, by no means ends the controversy.</p>
<p>Traditions, creeds, and dogmas die hard, and
fight to the last extremity. Nothing else known to
man fights so desperately and dies so hard as an
organized priesthood, and beyond this, they are
upheld by the ignorance, superstition, the fear, and
the faith of the masses.</p>
<p>Their adherents often believe and assume that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
they have discovered final truths, essential and unalterable
verities. They undertake to support and
to maintain these by dogmatic authority, a holy
book, a &#8220;thus sayeth the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is, down in black and white.&#8221; No
further evidence is required.</p>
<p>To question such authority is to be damned. To
believe, accept, and to conform, is to be <i>saved</i>.</p>
<p>Difference of opinion and of interpretation inevitably
arise, even among those who dare not question
the ultimate authority and genuineness of the
original revelation. Hence arise sects, schisms, and
theological warfare.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, the original revelation
becomes a matter of thorough investigation and of
criticism.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; had already discovered
errors in translation, and contradictions in
interpretation, resulting in a &#8220;revised edition&#8221; of
the sacred books, while under the name &#8220;<i>Pragmatism</i>,&#8221;
certain metaphysical writers and accredited
teachers have undertaken to determine essential
meanings and interpretations, and to submit religious
revelations, creeds, dogmas, and theologies to
critical analysis.</p>
<p>How far this analysis has gone, and how little of
the original interpretation actually remains, only
they are aware who keep abreast of current thought,
and who with open mind care more for the simple
truth than for custom, tradition, theologies, and the
folklore of the past.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Dogmatic theological authority is completely
undermined, and its days are numbered.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p>With the masses there is the habitual unrest, the
feeling of uncertainty, the social upheaval, with the
inevitable tendency to confusion and anarchy. A
new religion is already in the formative stage, a
new Avatar inevitable.</p>
<p>It is to be less a repudiation than a revision and
rehabilitation of the old religion.</p>
<p>People everywhere are looking for the new revelation,
for the coming of <i>Christos</i>, for the new
Avatar, and few are aware that he is already
here.</p>
<p>It should be borne strictly in mind that in every
instance in the past, the advent of the Avatar has
been unattended by signs and wonders, has come
upon the stage of human action in the most commonplace
way, and that myth, miracle, and folklore
have followed as time went on.</p>
<p>To the people of his time Jesus was the &#8220;son of
the carpenter,&#8221; whose family was obscure. He came
&#8220;eating with publicans and sinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus, the demigod of to-day, was unknown and
undreamed of in Galilee. Philo Judæus seems never
to have heard of him.</p>
<p>What and who Jesus was, and what he did, is
separated from what the church and theologians
have made of him by a gulf that seems almost
impassable, and yet this gulf has already been
bridged and passed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>The new Avatar has for its mission the rehabilitation
of Jesus as he actually existed, divested of all
myth and miracle, while the mission for which he
came, and the doctrines for which he lived and died
are to be completely restored to mankind in their
purity.</p>
<p>The old Hindoos would call this transformation a
&#8220;reincarnation of Vishnu,&#8221; a &#8220;new Avatar.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will mean Jesus the divine Man, the master,
<i>Christos</i>, restored to the heart of Humanity from
the mysticism and miracle of monks and theologies,
from the superstitions and folklore of the multitude.</p>
<p>This means a reconstruction and a restatement of
the religion of Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus remaining what he actually was and is, it
will be the province of Natural Science to explain
and to demonstrate by natural and spiritual law,
how, without mystery or miracle, Jesus became the
Master <i>Christos</i> and so remains to-day.</p>
<p>Natural Science is not the invention of man, more
than is the law of gravitation, the law of equilibrium,
or the binomial theorem. Man may discover these
laws from the phenomena of Nature, and demonstrate
their existence and mode of operation like
any others.</p>
<p>It is a question of dispassionate and intelligent
apprehension and demonstration.</p>
<p>All actual progress of man up to the present
time lies along these lines. Beyond this all is conjecture
and guess-work. Natural Science, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
is far more than modern physical science so-called.
It includes physical, mental, moral, and spiritual
science.</p>
<p>Its <i>methods</i> everywhere and at all times are the
same.</p>
<p>It may theorize, but never dogmatize, and it must
<i>demonstrate</i> at every step. Facts must not only
support the theorem, but demonstrate the conclusions
as inevitable, and the basis of all such actual
demonstration must be a verifiable individual experience,
with formulated laws and processes for its
repetition, just as in physical science, in chemistry,
and mathematics. Nothing less than this on any
plane or in any department of investigation can
enable the individual to declare &#8220;<i>I Know</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demonstration is the sign manual of knowledge;
Dogmatism the arrogance of ignorance.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make these radical distinctions
too clear and specific.</p>
<p>When this method of Natural Science is applied
to the investigation of religions, tradition is separated
from fact, dogma from demonstration, miracle
from natural law, mythology and folklore are
found to be the fabric woven by the imagination
of mankind around the receding revelations, deifying
their authors, and mingling fact with fable, till the
originals become unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Romance and superstition become substitutes for
simple Faith, moral law, and social Justice.</p>
<p>To question or to repudiate the dogmas of
superstition becomes a &#8220;mortal sin,&#8221; even when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the most plain and specific moral or ethical obligations
are entirely subverted or reversed by dogmatic
authority.</p>
<p>It is thus that the original revelation is subverted
and at last overthrown.</p>
<p>From first to last, the whole fabric is claimed
to be &#8220;sacred and divine,&#8221; and to question it,
&#8220;sacrilege&#8221; and &#8220;profanation of holy things.&#8221;
Thus, that which seemed originally as wings to the
toiling, sorrowing children of men, becomes at last
a &#8220;millstone about the neck,&#8221; a &#8220;burden grievous
to be borne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then comes protest, repudiation, reform, and
usually a new revelation, embodying the primitive
faith, and adapting it to modern times and conditions.</p>
<p>This is, in brief, the history of the Avatars of
Ancient India, the Buddhas and the Zoroasters of
later centuries; of the Greek Orpheus; of the legends
and folklore clustering around many of the sages
of Israel, and though in a less miraculous fashion,
of Confucius and Laotse. But most patent of all
does this principle apply to the founder of the
Christian religion, because less ancient and more
readily verifiable.</p>
<p>Though no new Avatar is yet recognized, the
<i>spirit</i> of <i>modern science</i> does not hesitate to repudiate
myth, miracle, and superstition, and to insist
on fact and natural law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The devout and conscientious believers in the
Christian Religion of to-day often view with
sorrow and alarm the encroachments of modern
science.</p>
<p>Unable to prevent these encroachments, they
stubbornly resent them. Once admitted, it seems
to them that nothing sacred or worthy the name of
Religion would remain. To shift to other and more
ancient faiths can never be considered at all, for
the &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; and &#8220;pragmatism&#8221; have left
them all in even a worse plight.</p>
<p>It seems to these devout souls like the death of
religion itself, and its elimination from the life of
man.</p>
<p>The intuitive basis and the intrinsic necessity of
religion in some form have already been considered.</p>
<p>This point is often overlooked or ignored by the
Iconoclasts.</p>
<p>Their position would seem to be, &#8220;Unravel the
superstition, disprove the possibility of miracle, and
let the deluge come if it must.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither pragmatism nor higher criticism has been
in any large sense constructive, but more largely
destructive. The really spiritual element in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
religions, already referred to, is generally lost
sight of.</p>
<p>Modern psychology is no nearer a science of the
soul, than are folklore and superstition to true
religion. It should be recognized and granted once
for all that psychology, as a department of modern
physical science, has no substitute whatever to offer
in the place of Religion.</p>
<p>It is gathering facts, classifying, and labeling
psychic phenomena.</p>
<p>Here and there an advanced scientist, like Sir
Oliver Lodge, ignores tradition, repudiates orthodox
scientific restraints, and steps over the border
of actual or implied nihilism.</p>
<p>This smug nihilism with its superior air of scientific
wisdom, is often only the opposite pole of the
dogmatic certitude of the churchman. Actual
knowledge of the human soul is quite as far removed
from the one as from the other. Credulity and Incredulity
simply annul each other; often make faces
at each other; while Progress stalks alone in the
middle of the road, a &#8220;tramp&#8221; or a &#8220;vagabond,&#8221;
like Paracelsus, &#8220;reading the leaves of the book
of Nature,&#8221; laughing at poverty, fleeing from persecution,
yet <i>knowing</i>, and &#8220;becoming a light to
man forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consensus of opinion among the presidents
and professors in the leading colleges and universities
of this country, their unhesitating and unqualified
denial or repudiation of the claims set up
by the church regarding revelation and the basic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
dogmas of the Christian Religion, and which his
&#8220;Holiness&#8221; of the Vatican designates as &#8220;Modernism,&#8221;
reveal, not only the &#8220;signs of the times,&#8221;
but show indisputably that modern education has
shaken itself free from the superstitions of the
past, and repudiated the old restraints to free
thought and modern progress.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy in religious matters has often nothing
to do in determining college curriculums, in the
selection of presidents, or in filling the chairs.</p>
<p>Bright young men and women, the advanced
students of the schools of to-day, who are to become
the leaders of thought and the teachers of to-morrow,
find little restraint and no formative element in
the creeds and dogmas that in the past have been
so much in evidence, and so constraining. Intensity
of feeling has given place to breadth and inclusiveness,
and under the name of &#8220;Comparative Religions,&#8221;
ancient faiths and modern, are classified,
and studied like fossils in the different ages of the
past.</p>
<p>The &#8220;crusader impulse&#8221; has rather settled down
in each individual breast, as the master passion, to
do, to dare, and to become something more and
better than the individual, or than the past has
hitherto known. Such a general period of intellectual
activity, with so few restraints, history nowhere
else records, and the world has never before
known.</p>
<p>Here lie the elements, the impulses, and the
formative stage of the new Avatar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>At this stage of our discussion it is of exceeding
interest and importance to bear in mind one great
fact. The average intelligent student of to-day
may take this fact tentatively, reserving final judgment
till accumulative evidence becomes satisfactory
and conclusive.</p>
<p>No one who is dominated by shallow incredulity,
and who attempts to close this door contemptuously,
will ever arrive at the real truth. The judgment
of such individuals is simply worthless,
notwithstanding the smug conceit of their own
opinions.</p>
<p>The important fact referred to, is the demonstrated
existence, all through the ages, of the so-called
<i>Mysteries</i>.</p>
<p>Their existence is beyond all question. What
they concealed and taught is sometimes difficult to
determine.</p>
<p>There were also the genuine and the spurious
Mysteries, and a fair appreciation of their origin,
purpose, methods, and genius, as illustrated by
Plato, Pythagoras, Zoroaster, and nearly every
great sage of antiquity, leaves no possible doubt
that in these &#8220;Secret Orders&#8221; were preserved the
loftiest and the most profound mental and spiritual
achievements of all previous human history.</p>
<p>If there were no other evidence in existence at
the present day except the traditions, landmarks,
ritual, and Genius of Freemasonry, a careful and
intelligent study of that Ancient Order would be
sufficient.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Whether one Mason in a thousand to-day apprehends
and realizes this fact, has nothing whatever to
do with the real question. The evidence is there, and
the indifference or superficial intelligence of numbers
cannot alter it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CONCEPTIONS AND PORTENTS OF AN AVATAR</h3>
</div>

<p>The conflict between Science and Religion has
been thoroughly thrashed out during the last
half century, and the &#8220;reign of law,&#8221; and orderly,
and progressive evolution, have made for themselves
a habitation and a name that nothing is likely to
overthrow.</p>
<p>It is recognized that every effect has a sufficient
and a commensurate cause, not <i>en bloc</i>, but in
matter, energy, mind, and spirit. Action and reaction
are definite mathematical processes. The
parallelogram of force tends everywhere to equilibrium
and secures further action and new processes
under universal law.</p>
<p>The &#8220;special creation&#8221; theory&mdash;everything made
out of nothing by a personal God&mdash;is no longer
regarded as tenable by intelligent individuals,
though miracle and special providence are often
included in accounting for the vicissitudes of life,
just as the so-called scientist superficially and flippantly
uses the word &#8220;coincidence,&#8221; as though it
really explained anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rational order that pervades the universe,&#8221;
as Prof. Huxley defined the concept and aim of
scientific discovery, has steadily gained ascendancy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
until it dominates and measures individual intelligence.</p>
<p>The criticism is still occasionally made that this
means Pantheism, overlooking the fact that in all
mythologies and cosmologies, an ideal and pure
theism was recognized as lying back of and beyond
the pantheons of the gods and the deification of the
powers of Nature.</p>
<p>This was true in the Greek, Persian, Egyptian,
and Hindoo mythologies. Back of the many, and
beyond the transient and contending divinities,
was the <i>One</i>, postulated, but unknown and changeless.</p>
<p>Every religion known to man, with the advancing
civilization of a people, copied, modified, adopted,
and adapted the mythology and folklore of
some pre-existing religion and people. This is
readily demonstrable with the Hebrew, Greek,
and later Christian dispensations, notwithstanding
the most strenuous and persistent determination
to deny, disprove, and destroy the ancient
records.</p>
<p>It is embodied in the etymology of the very names
of heroes, gods, and demigods. A new language
arising with any people <i>de novo</i> can nowhere be
found.</p>
<p>Phonetics and picturegraphs, the various alphabets
and glyphs, are mixed and modified, but never
invented nor altogether changed.</p>
<p>Complicated as they may be, it is thus that
philology, ethnology, theology, and anthropology
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
constitute a consistent whole, the mythology and
folklore of mankind. This reveals the practical
unity and solidarity of the human race.</p>
<p>The tradition and prophecy among the ancient
Hebrews of the coming of the Messiah, the portents
that heralded, and the signs and wonders that preceded
or accompanied his appearance, are merely
translations or adaptations from previous eras,
Buddhas, or Avatars.</p>
<p>Whether Christian or non-Christian, the object
of the advent is always identical.</p>
<p>The light of the spirit having become enfeebled
or obscured, the people are left in darkness and
given over to sin and wickedness. Moral ruin
seems inevitable unless there is a divine influx, a
new Avatar, or Buddha, or Advent of the God-man.</p>
<p>God incarnates himself as the son of Mary, and
Jesus says, &#8220;I am come a light into the world that
whosoever believeth in me should not abide in
darkness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christna says, &#8220;Though I am unborn, and my
nature is eternal, and I am the Lord also of all
creatures, yet taking control of my nature-form, I
am born by my illusive power. For whenever piety
decays, O son of Bharata, and impiety is in the
ascendant, then I produce myself. For the protection
of good men, for the destruction of evildoers,
for the re-establishment of piety, I am born
from age to age.&#8221; (Bhagavadgita.)</p>
<p>The historical Buddha taught that he was only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
one of a long series of Buddhas, who appear at
intervals in the world, and who all teach the same
system. After the death of each Buddha his religion
flourishes for a time and then decays, till at last
it is completely forgotten and wickedness and violence
rule the earth. The names of twenty-four
of these Buddhas who appeared previous to Gautama
have been handed down to us, just as the &#8220;second
coming of Christ&#8221; is believed in and referred to
among the Christians.</p>
<p>Even the Mohammedan Koran refers to this
succession of prophets and messengers of Allah.
The same is true of the Parsis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said that I first of all chose Abad, and
after him I sent thirteen prophets in succession, all
called Abad. By these fourteen prophets the world
enjoyed prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tradition informs us that when these auspicious
prophets and their successors behold evil to prevail
among mankind, they invariably withdraw from
among them&mdash;as they could not endure to behold or
hear wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely what happened to Egypt after
the ambitious priesthood had gained the ascendency.
The Master Builders retired.</p>
<p>Bonwick says (&#8220;Egyptian Belief and Modern
Thought&#8221;): &#8220;What is commonly called the <i>Christ
idea</i> of humanity, thus appears to have been the
hope and consolation of the ancient Egyptians so
many thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>That which thus appears and disappears, dies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
out and is born again, is the spiritual light in the
soul of man.</p>
<p>The diversity of man&#8217;s intellectual activities exercise,
elaborate, and deepen his mental perceptions, and
these largely concern the things of sense and time,
his appetites, passions, desires, and ambitions.</p>
<p>Back of and beyond all these lie the things of the
spirit. On the physical plane of life the former
obscure and crowd out the latter, which are thus
continually in need of renewal.</p>
<p>In adapting the new revelation to the conditions
of life on the physical plane, it is intellectualized
and theologized. Pundits and theologians undertake
to <i>explain</i> what it all means and how it happened
to be. Hence arise wrangles, disputes, and
finally creeds, dogmas, and persecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men fight like devils for the love of God.&#8221;
This is the ultimate history of every religion known
to man.</p>
<p>Meantime, the soul of man, a spiritual being
dwelling in a material body on the physical plane,
is seeking real knowledge of spiritual things.</p>
<p>This real knowledge is an experience of the soul.
It concerns, and is comprised in, the <i>living of a life</i>.
It is more than mind or intellect. It is <i>knowledge</i>
gained by experience. &#8220;This only I know, that
whereas I was blind, now I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether in the body or out of the body, I know
not, but I saw things impossible to utter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gradually man&#8217;s <i>idea</i> of God and his conception
of Nature have changed and enlarged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>Man, as a spiritual being, is part of a spiritual
universe. He has been able to harmonize his concept
of God and Nature progressively as he has
gained larger views and deeper insight of both.
He is no longer a puppet of infinite caprice, nor
a somewhat &#8220;improved animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of man as a &#8220;fallen god&#8221; with the
capacity to regain his heavenly estate, is far nearer
the truth.</p>
<p>As man advances in knowledge through the combined
experiences of his spiritual nature and his
physical embodiment, his beliefs change, his horizon
enlarges, and his concepts become elevated and
purified. The past is apprehended and utilized and
the future intelligently anticipated. He begins to
understand.</p>
<p>This means the recognition of law and order,
permanency, <i>Foundation</i>, and stability.</p>
<p>The birth stories, the portents, signs and wonders
that announce, accompany, or follow the birth of a
Messiah or Avatar, are almost identical. A common
instinct seems to have led all scripture-compilers
to infer a simultaneous stimulus of nature
and man upon the appearance of what the Hindoo
calls an Avatar.</p>
<p>Men, too, seem prepared to expect such an advent
as its necessary time approaches. It is an instinct
which tells them that &#8220;the darkest hour precedes
the dawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Christian scriptures the premonitions and
birth stories are found largely in the Apocryphal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
books. Doubtless the copying and substitution
from the lives of Christna and Buddha were too
plain.</p>
<p>At the death of Jesus the seismic, astral, and
cosmic disturbances are graphically described, as
befitting the death of a god. &#8220;The veil of the temple
was rent in twain,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that mankind feels instinctively
in the soul the far-reaching influences at work.
The spiritual nature is stirred to its depths, and
when he tries to describe what he sees and feels,
his emotions, fears, or aspirations being at white
heat, his imagination draws from the folklore of
other times, races, and religions, to express what
he so powerfully, but vaguely senses.</p>
<p>But beyond all this, the time of great religious
revivals and social upheavals is likely to coincide
with seismic disturbance, tidal waves and the like,
owing to the conjunction of planets under the
general law of cycles. Man is completely involved
with and evolved from the bosom of Nature. His
freedom is determined by knowledge and obedience
to Law.</p>
<p>From the mystic Hymns of Orpheus, with the
legends of Gods, demigods, and heroes, and the
personification of the varied powers of man and
nature, arose the Greek Pantheon, which, in poetic
concept, romantic and dramatic embodiment and
expression, as a concise and complete whole, has
probably never been equaled by man.</p>
<p>True, every essential element, under a different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
name and detail, may be found elsewhere, but never
equaled in concise and constructive folklore and
mythology.</p>
<p>But running underneath all this, like a vein of
gold under the mountain, was the philosophy of
Plato. Grasping the <i>One</i> from the many, Unity
from the fantastic diversity, he came to the individual
experience of the human soul and its
conscious mastership over the body and the things
of sense and time.</p>
<p>Civic pride, patriotism, and heroism, walked side
by side with dialectics, and the pantheon of the
gods and the achievements of warriors rivaled each
other on the stage, as themes for the poetic philosopher
and dramatist.</p>
<p>Mythology and folklore here furnished a background
from which the philosophy of the mysteries
and the real science of life gained a hearing.</p>
<p>Plato and Pythagoras generalized, and with many
reservations represented that which they had been
taught in the mysteries of Egypt.</p>
<p>Greece, with its triumphs in literature, in the
drama and in art, and all its magnificent civilization,
knew no Avatar.</p>
<p>Jacolliot, in his &#8220;Bible in India,&#8221; has shown
conclusively that not only the whole Greek pantheon,
its folklore and mythology, and even its civil code
were adopted from the Laws of Manu and the far
older Aryan civilization, including even the names
of heroes.</p>
<p>The fame of Greece rests upon its <i>Genius for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Construction</i> in Art and Architecture and the
Drama, and upon the open door it gave to Philosophy.
There was no dominant priesthood to
close the door of progress.</p>
<p>It utilized all the past and built and beautified
the present.</p>
<p>It bequeathed no creed nor dogma to the future,
and yet its civilization was transcendent and is
immortal.</p>
<p>It had its canons of Art and of Architecture.
These it demonstrated by constructive work. It
illustrated, explained and exemplified, but it did
not argue nor dogmatize.</p>
<p>The world for two thousand years has been
&#8220;going back to Greece&#8221; and trying to explain how
it all happened, just as we have been trying to
explain Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Faust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genius is transcendent and immortal.</p>
<p>With the decline of Greece there arose the Genius
of the Tiber, Imperial Rome, and the Cæsars.</p>
<p>Rome created an <i>Avatar</i> out of the &#8220;Babe of
Bethlehem.&#8221; Having enthroned Jehovah, it proceeded
to deify Jesus, and then by substitution to
take the place of both.</p>
<p>Imperial Rome, the &#8220;Scarlet Mother of the
Tiber,&#8221; assumed the government and dictatorship
of the world. Imperial, dogmatic, relentless, the
arbiter of the fate of humanity on earth and beyond.</p>
<p>Here was arbitrary, relentless <i>power</i> at any cost,
to be maintained on any terms. &#8220;The end always
justified the means.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>In the civilization of Greece, the Individual, the
citizen was first, and association and co-operation
built the State.</p>
<p>With Rome the Individual is nothing but a pawn,
an accessory to the Church. It was and is the
Church first, last, and all the time. The Individual
can claim no right nor prerogative except as a concession
from the Church.</p>
<p>The contrast is extreme and absolute between the
Genius of Greece and that of Rome.</p>
<p>As the Genius of Greece was adapted from the
older Aryan, so also was that of Rome, from the
Brahmans, through Egypt.</p>
<p>Among the various Avatars of old India designated
as &#8220;Incarnations of Vishnu,&#8221; Siva &#8220;<i>the destroyer</i>,&#8221;
was often in evidence.</p>
<p>Rome proceeded to adopt the Hindoo Trinity&mdash;Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva&mdash;(the Creator, the Preserver,
and the Destroyer), and to so shape its
creed and dogmas as to secure and maintain the
power of Mother Church, simply with a change of
names&mdash;&#8220;Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has enslaved nations and slaughtered millions
in order to maintain its power. For more than fifteen
hundred years it has maintained its relentless
warfare against the inalienable rights of the Individual,
and the inevitable progress of humanity.</p>
<p>It has escaped the execration of the world only
by its priestly trick of deifying Jesus and sophisticating
every doctrine that he taught. Supporting
its pretensions by Mariolatry, the Auricular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
Confession, and its army of spies and inquisitors,
it has dominated mankind, impoverished whole
nations, devastated provinces and murdered all who
opposed its progress wherever and whenever it has
gained civil power.</p>
<p>Rome is to-day the literal and visible reincarnation
of <i>Siva</i>, the <i>Avatar of Destruction</i>. She has
originated nothing. Her mass and all her ritualistic
mummeries are adopted from paganism at its worst
stage and in its most degenerate form, and she
awaits the fate that befell Egypt and all her
predecessors, &#8220;Sodom, Gomorrah, and the cities of
the plain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Protestantism has hitherto &#8220;protested&#8221; only in
part. Refusing Mariolatry and auricular confession,
Protestantism, by accepting the miraculous
conception, the deification of Jesus and the vicarious
atonement, has kept Rome in countenance.</p>
<p>When these are swept away, and their doom is
already declared by the leaders of thought in nearly
all our institutions of higher learning, the Roman
<i>Avatar</i> will stand revealed in all its nakedness and
villainy to the execration of mankind. It is this
&#8220;<i>Modernism</i>&#8221; that &#8220;His Holiness&#8221; so much fears
and is trying to arrest. It is too late, unless
civilization and the march of time move backward.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about it all is, how the
world, with its present intelligence and culture, can
be so indifferent to this most aggressive, cruel, and
relentless Avatar of all the ages, instead of repelling
it with contempt and execration.

<p>Thirty-seven Italian Cardinals,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> proud and arrogant,
rule the Church, elect the Pope, and assume
dictatorship of the earth, as also arbiters of human
destiny, here and hereafter. America, the corn-bin
of this modern Egypt, by courtesy has <i>one cardinal</i>,
just to keep her in countenance.</p>
<p>The effrontery is cyclopean, but our supineness
and indifference are deplorable and inexcusable.</p>
<p>Shipping her impoverished, degraded, criminal,
and priest-ridden hordes to America by the million
every year, Rome is massing her army for the
overthrow of our government and all our present
civilization. With her dogma of obedience, her
army now <i>votes</i> and will, by and by, <i>fight</i> under
the dictatorship of the Cardinals at Rome. Already
undermining our Public Free Schools, boycotting
the public press, with their army of Jesuit spies
and secret assassins of every liberty prized by man,
the &#8220;merry war&#8221; goes on right under our eyes, and
we sleep and dream and blindly assume that &#8220;there
is no danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read the history of the Crusaders, of the Protestant
Reformation and of the &#8220;Holy Inquisition,&#8221;
and if further enlightenment is needed, study the
origin, history, and denouement of all the Avatars
of the past, the fate of Egypt, the cities of the
plain, where paganism and a degenerate priesthood
usurped the place of pure and undefiled
religion, and literally wiped from the map of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
world the civilizations of the past. <i>Nemesis</i> is written
in letters of flame across the starry heavens, as
an atonement for the blood of nations and the
degeneracy and diabolism of an ambitious, cruel,
relentless, and unrestrained priesthood. And it is
all being literally repeated to-day without the
novelty of a new idea, or method, or device, or
motive. It is <i>The Reincarnation of the Avatar of
Siva, the Destroyer</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>PORTENTS OF THE PRESENT TIME</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no disguising nor denying the fact
that during the past half century institutional
religion in the West has steadily lost its hold upon
the great mass of the people. Creeds and dogmas
are denied and repudiated.</p>
<p>The &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; represents the reluctant
yielding of theologians to the existing conditions.
In order to maintain any hold whatever upon the
people and retain a semblance of the old faith, they
have revised and modified beliefs and interpretations,
and relaxed completely the former demand
for the confession of faith and acceptance of the
old creeds. Mere general verbal assent admitting
of many mental reservations is now often deemed
sufficient.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the living of the life and the
doing of the work demanded by Jesus have come
more and more into demand and general recognition.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Emmanuel Movement,&#8221; now gaining such
recognition and making such rapid progress, is
sufficient evidence at this point.</p>
<p>With the Church of Rome no such change is
manifest. By keeping its people in ignorance, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
condemning all change or any improvement under
the name of &#8220;Modernism,&#8221; and by insisting upon
the dogma of infallibility and blind obedience, Rome
thus far has resisted all change and refused all
compromise.</p>
<p>The change in Protestantism represents the
growth of intelligence, the recognition of the rights
of conscience, and individual and intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>The stability so apparent in Romanism relies
solely on Ignorance, Superstition, and Fear, enforced
by the dogma of &#8220;<i>Infallibility</i>,&#8221; and reinforced
by the power of &#8220;Excommunication&#8221; and
the penalty of &#8220;Anathema.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unity and stability of the Roman Church,
thus secured by force, will presently be found to be
apparent only. It could only work and hold in
the dark ages. Internal division and dissension,
now known to exist, await only some fresh act of
oppression, or some new abomination, or abuse of
political power, to disrupt its solidarity.</p>
<p>In the meantime physical science has steadily
advanced, opening new avenues of wealth, industry,
and opportunity, and so developing the resources
of this Western world.</p>
<p>But more important and far-reaching still have
been the discoveries regarding the finer forces of
nature.</p>
<p>The wonderful development and application of
discoveries in Electricity have not only opened a
new world previously unknown and unsuspected,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
but have seemed to endow these subtle forces almost
with an intelligence of their own. Crass
materialism is dead and space practically annihilated.</p>
<p>If a single wire or a vibrating disc cannot
originate intelligent speech, it can retain, repeat,
and transmit the qualities, tones and inflections of
the human voice in a way that seems miraculous and
uncanny. It is thus that our concepts of nature
have been enlarged, refined, and actually spiritualized.
&#8220;Brutal&#8221; and &#8220;dead&#8221; matter are no
longer in evidence nor even mentioned.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern spiritualism came
another group of phenomena. Making the largest
allowance for fraud, self-deception, and all the
vagaries of the imagination, no intelligent individual,
familiar with the phenomena, will attempt to
deny the extension of man&#8217;s psychic world of consciousness
and the manifestation of intelligence in
ways and under conditions previously unknown.
The identification of these intelligences, always
difficult, and generally problematical, need not here
be discussed at all. The facts and the phenomena
are all that we are here concerned with.</p>
<p>The most important consideration regarding all
these phenomena is that they do not <i>develop</i>, but on
the contrary <i>dominate</i> the individual. They are,
in fact, altogether subjective. The medium may
put himself in the negative or passive condition to
be controlled, but he cannot <i>command</i> nor <i>control</i>
the influence nor the &#8220;entity&#8221; that influences him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
and eventually he loses the power to resist it, and
likewise the power of self-control.</p>
<p>Science demands <i>facts</i>, and here are facts in
abundance. These facts supplement the discoveries
in electricity and nature&#8217;s finer forces, and pass
from physics to metaphysics, from physiology to
psychology, and push back the veil of the unseen,
and hitherto unknown, many degrees.</p>
<p>The trend of all this progress, and of these discoveries,
is exceedingly plain.</p>
<p>Our concepts of Nature, of Life, and of Man
have been almost immeasurably enlarged, refined,
and elevated.</p>
<p>Expectancy is in the air. &#8220;What next is going
to happen?&#8221; is the question everywhere asked. The
conditions and portents, in a general way, are those
that herald a new Avatar; an Avatar now, of science
rather than of religion; of knowledge rather than of
faith, and this knowledge is to be of spiritual things,
the foundations of which are already in evidence.</p>
<p>This science is not to be time-serving, but man-serving;
not so much a renewal of faith as a revelation
of knowledge; less anxious for the glory of
God than for the elevation of man, which is the
more direct and certain way of honoring Divinity.</p>
<p>This does not mean the decay nor the repudiation
of religion, but a <i>realization</i> of <i>true</i> religion, such
as heretofore prophets have foretold, revelation has
forecast, and toward which humanity has toiled
and journeyed in sorrow and pain; the very religion
that Jesus lived and taught. &#8220;A clean life,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
an open mind, an unveiled spiritual perception, a
brotherliness for all, and human life a journeying
upward toward the realms of eternal day, &#8216;with no
night there, and no sorrow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><i>And why not?</i> If man can conceive it, why may
he not <i>realize</i> it? The &#8220;Old Adam&#8221; as an excuse
is exploded. The &#8220;New Adam&#8221; is indeed &#8220;a
quickening spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing is plainer nor more demonstrable at the
present day than the fact that mankind is slowly
but surely shaking off the traditions and the superstitions
that have bound it in the past, rising above
the myths and the folklore of every age and clime,
and awaking as if from slumber, to behold a new
day and a new world.</p>
<p>This awakening is even more in evidence and
remarkable in the case of woman than of man.
Progress here during the last decade has been such
as the world has never before seen on any such
scale, and it means more to the elevation of humanity
than anyone has hitherto been able to forecast
or to measure.</p>
<p>In the meantime social and economic conditions
with the great masses of the people are very far
from what they should be.</p>
<p>Unrest and confusion are strongly in evidence.
On the whole, there is far less suffering and destitution
than ever before. Oppression and abominations
meet with quick and powerful protest from all
classes, when exposed, and at least temporary relief
is quick to follow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>The blame is confined to no one class, rich or
poor. The equitable distribution of wealth, resources,
and opportunity that have developed beyond
all precedent during the last half century,
requires time. Justice and equity are not dead,
but everywhere in evidence, dominating mankind
at large. Public sentiment was never more keen
and never nearer right than to-day. There is
general confusion, however, as to methods and ways
and means. The cunning shark and the selfish
brute resort to concealment, cunning and subterfuge,
to deceive the people and often succeed for a time,
only to meet with condemnation and execration
later. Injustice is often in evidence, but it is
neither rampant nor dominant. It stands in fear
of public sentiment.</p>
<p>These, in brief and in outline, are the conditions,
the portents, to-day, everywhere in evidence:</p>
<p>1. The decay of creeds and dogmas.</p>
<p>2. Great progress in Science, Art, and the Crafts.</p>
<p>3. Immense discoveries regarding Nature&#8217;s finer
forces and the psychical powers latent in man.</p>
<p>4. Great expectancy as to new revelations.</p>
<p>5. Unprecedented increase in wealth and the development
of natural resources.</p>
<p>6. Enfranchisement of woman, and immense
progress as to her rights and opportunities.</p>
<p>7. Economic Justice recognized and aimed at,
and fortified by public sentiment, with strong efforts
to secure and maintain it.</p>
<p>The present age or epoch is not one of darkness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
but of light; not of discouragement, but of hope.
It is neither retrograde nor stagnant, but progressive
to a degree never before witnessed in the history
of man on so large a scale and involving all
classes and so many people at one time.</p>
<p>Organized or institutional religion alone is on
the wane. Evidence and utility are everywhere
demanded. Nothing is sacred simply because it is
old; nor true merely because it is dogmatically
asserted so to be.</p>
<p>Holy books, holy men, and holy days are matters
of evidence, and not of blind credence.</p>
<p>What will the new religion&mdash;the new revelation&mdash;be?
and whence will it come?</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SEPARABLE SOUL IN FOLKLORE</h3>
</div>

<p>Belief in a separable soul in man is virtually
universal. Such belief is found amongst the
lowest races, and in the few instances where it has
not been clearly discovered it is admitted that it may
still exist and be disguised by the native meaning
of words or signs that escape the explorer.</p>
<p>The universality of this belief has often been
urged as an evidence of its validity and proof of the
soul&#8217;s existence.</p>
<p>Modern physical science deduces this belief from
the phenomena of daily life and the analogies of
individual experience, thus giving precedence to
material causes for mental concepts, or universal
ideas. This view is, I think, entitled to the most
careful consideration, but it cannot once for all
be admitted, nor is it consistent with the general
theory and progress of evolution that the phenomenal
stands to the noumenal, the actual to the
ideal, as cause to effect. These two groups of experiences
are alternate and coincident; and, as to
priority, it is only the old question in a new form,
as to which was first, the bird that laid the egg, or
the egg that hatched the bird.</p>
<p>This distinction is particularly pertinent to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
present subject, for the reason that by the method
of modern physical science, in dealing with the
belief in the existence of the soul, the whole of
this universal belief is swept away. Its origin is
found in the ignorance, superstition, and false
analogies of barbarous races, and the inference is
that the belief can only linger as a remnant of
superstition among civilized men. This method prejudges
the whole question, and (while it must
readily be admitted that the opposite method equally
prejudges it), my contention is for neither the one
nor the other, but for the careful consideration and
final blending of both. If at first sight these two
theories, which form the basis of the working
hypothesis of the materialist and the spiritist, seem
paradoxical and wholly irreconcilable, with careful
consideration and unbiased investigation of both
sides of the problem the paradox will disappear.</p>
<p>With both the lowest and the highest races not
only do we find the existence of belief in the existence
of a separable soul in man, but of ghosts,
gods, genii, a spirit of the air, and hierarchies of
celestial and infernal beings.</p>
<p>In this regard, philosophers like Plato and Pythagoras,
the intellectual giants of the human race,
may be said to have elaborated and specialized the
rude conceptions of the Fiji Islander, and to vie
with him in peopling space with invisible entities
and potencies. In spite of the dictum of science,
the world, intelligent and ignorant alike, believes,
and will continue to believe, in the reality of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
unseen universe, and the Platonic doctrine of
&#8220;emanation&#8221; and the &#8220;world of divine ideas&#8221; not
only begin where modern physical science leaves off,
but at this very point science either begs the question,
or ignores it entirely.</p>
<p>How things come to be what they are, and to
evolve as they do, science nowhere declares. It
simply takes things as it finds them, and dubs the
ultimate and antecedent causation the <i>Unknowable</i>.
The philosophy of Plato, it is true, reaches at last
the unknowable and the incomprehensible, but only
after revealing another universe, the metaphysical
and spiritual, entirely unknown to, or ignored or
derided by the materialist.</p>
<p>It is, however, from this invisible realm that all
visible things have come forth, the two being not
only under absolute and universal law, but bearing
everywhere definite analogies to each other. Hence
Plato says, &#8220;God geometrizes.&#8221; Absolute mathematics
determines the relations of atoms to suns,
and the circulation of the blood in man to the
revolutions of suns and solar systems.</p>
<p>A further general consideration remains to be
noted before taking up the evidence of belief in
the separable soul, and that is, the evolutionary life-wave
of humanity on our earth.</p>
<p>The progress of man for some millions of years
past has by no means been a straightforward climbing
from barbarism to civilization. The wave of
evolution has ebbed and flowed. While at one
place man has slowly emerged from savagery, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
another he has as surely sunk to it. Continents
and islands have risen from and again sunk to
the bottom of the sea, bearing the races of men in
their upheavals or descent, and cataclysmic and
seismic or volcanic upheavals have blotted out in a
day the accumulated progress of centuries. The
poles of the earth have shifted with results to the
life of the globe more awful than the imagination
can portray. Bodies of people like our North
American Indians represent the remains of many
peoples, as in Russia or India to-day, fragments
of many nationalities are being absorbed in
one.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind, therefore, that owing to many
causes a nation may descend to barbarism or disappear
entirely, we shall find everywhere the fragments
and decay of the old belief no less than the
dawn of the new. A noble creed, or a philosophical
concept of a highly advanced race, may exist as a
transformed and degrading superstition with a
race, or a fragment of a people, undergoing degeneracy.</p>
<p>Every religion known to man has gone through
just this transformation. The tendency is innate
and inevitable and no civilization or religion has
ever yet been able long to resist it. If we bear
this in mind we shall be less surprised at anthropogeneses,
cosmogeneses or psychologies found sometimes
among otherwise rude or savage peoples, and
be better able to understand the incongruities and
lack of symmetry in their evolution. It would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
easy to cite instances and draw comparisons at
this point.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind, then, these general considerations
underlying all interpretation, and nowhere
more applicable than to our present subject, the
following illustrations of belief in the separable
soul, gleaned largely from Spencer&#8217;s &#8220;Descriptive
Sociology,&#8221; may be of interest. It is drawn largely
from the lower civilizations, as all are more or less
familiar with the mythologies of the Greeks,
Babylonians, Ph&oelig;nicians, etc., all of which are
accessible. The material available is embarrassing
on account of its magnitude alone.</p>
<p>Oscar Peschel, in his &#8220;Races of Man,&#8221; says that
&#8220;perhaps the Brazilian Botocudos, of all the inhabitants
of the world, are most nearly in the
primitive state, and yet,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;possibly we may
be altogether mistaken in this regard, as their
languages are very imperfectly known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humboldt rescued the Caribs from such an impeachment
and declares that their language &#8220;combines
wealth, grace, strength, and gentleness. It
has expressions for abstract ideas, for Futurity,
Eternity, and Existence, and enough numerical
terms to express all possible combinations of our
numerals.&#8221; It might be noted in passing that it
was these same Brazilian natives that the Portuguese
settlers sought to decimate by spreading
smallpox and scarlet fever amongst them, as the
English colonists in Tasmania shot the natives
when they had no better food for their dogs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>Hariot says that &#8220;many of the Indian natives
of North and South America believe that the soul,
after its separation from the body, enters into a
wide path crowded with spirits which are journeying
toward a region of eternal repose. They have
to cross an impetuous river on a trembling wicker
bridge which is very dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Greenlanders believe that the soul can go
astray out of the body for a considerable time.
Some believe that they can leave their souls at home
when going on a journey, and others believe in the
migration of souls.</p>
<p>Belief in the soul and a future state is universal
among the Indians of North America. All are
familiar with the tradition of the &#8220;Happy Hunting
Ground.&#8221; With them the future life is patterned
after the present.</p>
<p>Schoolcraft says that the Chippewas believe that
there are duplicate souls, one of which remains with
the body, while the other is free to depart on excursions
during sleep. After death the soul departs
to the Indian Elysium and a fire is kept burning
on the newly-made grave for four days, the time
required for the soul to reach its destination.</p>
<p>The Dakotas stand in great fear of the spirits
of the dead, who they think have power to injure
them, and they recite prayers and give offerings to
appease them.</p>
<p>The Mandans, according to Schoolcraft, have
anticipated Prof. Lloyd&#8217;s Etidorhpa, even to the
beautiful maiden. They believe that they were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
first people created on the earth, and that they
first lived inside the globe. They raised many vines,
one of which having grown up through a hole in the
earth, one of the young men climbed up until he
crawled out on the bank of the river where the
Mandan village stands. (Jack and the bean stalk.)
The young man returned to the nether world and
piloted several of his companions to the outer
world, and among them two very beautiful virgins.
Among those who tried to get up was a very
large and fat woman, who was ordered by the
chiefs to remain behind. Her curiosity prompted
her secretly to make the trial. The vine broke
under her weight and she was badly hurt by the
fall, but did not die, and was ever after in disgrace
for having cut off all communication with the
upper world. Those who had already ascended built
the Mandan village, and when these die they expect
to return to the nether world from which they came.
They also believe the earth a great tortoise, and
have a tradition of a universal deluge.</p>
<p>The Indians of Guiana believe in the immortality
of the soul, as do also the Arawaks. The
Brazilians are said by Spix and Martins to have
had no religious belief whatever before mingling with
the civilized races. The Guaranis believed in a soul
which remained in the grave with the body.</p>
<p>The Patagonians believe in a country of the
dead which they call Alhue Mapu and they kill the
horses of the deceased in order that their owner may
ride in Alhue Mapu.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>From the beliefs of the Negritto and Malayo-Polynesian
races, I glean the following: The Fuegians
believe in a superior being, and in good and
evil spirits, in dreams, omens, signs, etc. Fitzroy
says he could not satisfy himself that they had any
idea of the immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>The Veddahs believe in the guardianship of the
spirits of the dead, who visit them in dreams and
minister to them in sickness, and they have ceremonies
of invocation.</p>
<p>Eyra says some at least of the Australians believe
in the existence and separability of the soul.</p>
<p>The Tasmanians believed in a future life as a
tradition of a primitive religion, and Bonwick says
they conversed with the spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>The New Caledonians believe that white men
are the spirits of the dead, and that they bring
sickness. They believe that the soul on leaving
the body goes to the Bush, and every fifth month
they have a &#8220;spirit night&#8221; or &#8220;grand concert of
spirits.&#8221; The gods of the New Caledonians are
their ancestors, whose relics they keep and idolize.</p>
<p>The Fijians believe in a separable soul, and dying
is by them described by the same terms as sunset.</p>
<p>Belief in a future state among them is said by
Siemann to be universal. In Fiji heaven the inhabitants
plant, live in families, fight, and so repeat
the incidents of life on earth. They believe
that the spirit of men, while still alive, may leave
the body and trouble other people when asleep.</p>
<p>The Sandwich Islanders believe that the spirit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
of the departed hovers about his former home,
appears to his relatives in dreams, and they worship
an image which they believe to be in some
way connected with the departed. They regard
the spirit of one of their ancient kings as a tutelar
deity, and the king and the priest were believed
to be descended from the gods.</p>
<p>The Tahitians believe in a separable soul which,
on leaving the body, is seized by other spirits and
conducted to the state of night, where it is by
degrees eaten by the gods. A few escape this fate,
while others, after being three times eaten, become
immortal.</p>
<p>The Tongons believe that the human soul is the
more ethereal part of the body and that it exists
in Bolotoo in the form and likeness of the body
the moment after death.</p>
<p>The Samoans believe that the spirits of the dead
have power to return and to cause disease and
death in other members of the family, hence all
are anxious to part with the dying on good terms.</p>
<p>The New Zealanders believe that during sleep
the mind leaves the body, and that dreams are the
objects seen during its wanderings. They believe
in two separate abodes for departed spirits, the sky,
and the sea, and that the abodes of souls are to be
approached only down the face of a steep precipice&mdash;Cape
Maria Van Dieman.</p>
<p>The Dyaks have great difficulty in distinguishing
sleep from death. They believe that the soul during
sleep goes on an expedition of its own, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sees, hears, and talks. They believe in spirits,
omens, and in all that occurs in dreams as real and
literally true.</p>
<p>The Sumatrans believe in spirits and superior
beings, and are said to have a vague idea of the
immortality of the soul, and the Malays believe in
spirits, good and bad, and seem to have a vague
idea of a separable soul.</p>
<p>The Mexicans believed in a separable soul, and
distinguished three different abodes for it after
death.</p>
<p>Landa says the people of Yucatan have always
believed more firmly in the immortality of the soul
than other people, though they were less advanced
in civilization. They believed that after death there
would be a better life, which the soul would enjoy
after its separation from the body. They worshiped
their dead kings as gods. The mythology
of the people of Guatemala, Honduras, and
Nicaragua is extensive and complicated and their
National Book, the Popol Vuh, possesses intense
interest for the student. There can be no doubt
that these people believed in a separable soul, as
did also the Chibchas.</p>
<p>It was the belief of the ancient Peruvians that
the soul leaves the body during sleep, and that the
soul itself cannot sleep, but that dreams are what
the soul sees in the world while the body sleeps.
Waitz says they believed in the transmigration of
human souls into the bodies of animals.</p>
<p>In the case of the Arabians the primitive belief,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
which was Sabianism, has been altered far less
by Mohammedan invasion than most persons suppose.
Burton says Mohammed and his followers
conquered only the more civilized Bedouins, and
Baker says that the Arabs are unchanged, and that
the theological opinions which they now hold are
the same as those which prevailed in remote ages,
and of this belief the soul and its immortality
formed a part.</p>
<p>In general the Hill Tribes of India share in the
universal belief in the soul, in spirits, gods, and
devils, though of many of these tribes little is
really known in modern times.</p>
<p>Nearly all our North American Indians (I can
find no exceptions) bury objects with their dead,
such as food implements, jewelry, etc., and kill
the horses of the deceased that he may ride in the
Happy Hunting Ground.</p>
<p>With the Carib&#8217;s death his wife and captives were
killed, and food utensils, etc., were buried with
him.</p>
<p>A curious custom prevailed with some Brazilian
tribes. After burying food, utensils, arms, etc.,
with the body, a month after death the body was
disinterred, put in a pan over a fire, the volatile
substances driven off, the black residue reduced to
powder and mixed with water and drunk by the
company.</p>
<p>The Patagonians bury all the possessions of the
deceased with the body.</p>
<p>With the Hottentots, widows lose one joint of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
a finger as an offering to the deceased husband
every time they re-marry.</p>
<p>With the Kaffirs, the hut and utensils of the
deceased are burnt. The East Africans offer
prayer to the dead.</p>
<p>The Congo people bury ornaments, utensils, arms,
etc., and embalm the body after one or two years.
The body of the chief must be carried in a straight
line from the hut to place of burial, and if trees
or huts impede the passage, they are cut down.</p>
<p>The Coast Negroes bury property with the body
and have a ceremony like an Irish wake, as do also
the Abyssinians.</p>
<p>With the Ashantis, gold dust and utensils are
buried and human sacrifices occur.</p>
<p>The wives of the Fijians are strangled that they
may attend their lords in the new country.</p>
<p>The people of Malagasy bury in vaults 10×12,
and 7 feet high, and put in a large quantity of
property.</p>
<p>With the ancient Mexicans, wives, slaves, concubines,
and chaplains were slaughtered to attend the
deceased.</p>
<p>The Arabs fasten the camels to the grave of
their master.</p>
<p>The Todas cremate the dead and slaughter the
whole herd of buffalo belonging to him, in order
to secure them to him in the after life.</p>
<p>I have by no means given a complete category
of the primitive and barbarous peoples who believe
in a separate soul, and who believe in a future
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
state much like the present and in conformity with
that belief bury arms, ornaments, and utensils with
the dead or place them on the grave, and who
slaughter horses, camels, wives, slaves, etc., in order
that the deceased may retain his possessions. How
far these customs extend in case of the death of
woman I do not know, but as with most of these
people the women are regarded as chattels of the
males, the case is doubtless very different.</p>
<p>Now as to the origin of these beliefs and customs,
their causes naturally fall into two categories,
the physical and the metaphysical. Modern biological
science regards the whole question from
the physical side almost exclusively, and facts and
experiences that belong largely or exclusively to
the metaphysical realm are warped out of their
natural order to fit the theory of interpretation.</p>
<p>Every savage observes not only that he casts
a shadow, but that shadows attend all inanimate
objects that stand so as to intercept the light, and
as shadows move as do objects that gives rise to the
idea of animation. Hence we have genii, dryads,
naiads, ghosts, angels, demons, etc. To fortify this
belief we have echoes, which give voice to animate
and inanimate objects. Movement and voice are
the universal accompaniment of animation.</p>
<p>The part played by the breath, and its sudden
cessation at death, are believed to contribute to the
belief in invisible existences.</p>
<p>The beating of the heart, and its cessation at
death, adds another link to the chain of phenomena,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
going to show that <i>something</i> leaves the body at
death. This may be the origin of the sacrifice
of the hearts of captives to the gods,
or to a deceased warrior or chief as with the ancient
Mexicans, with the belief that the heart is the
seat of the soul, and the soul of the captive or
victim shall attend the departed chief in the other
world.</p>
<p>But the most important place should doubtless
be assigned to dreams as giving rise to belief in
the world of spirits. Dreams are universal amongst
men, and animals like the dog also dream.</p>
<p>Most if not all primitive people are also aware
that fasting promotes dreaming, and while many of
them practice long fasting, partly, no doubt, to
increase fortitude and bodily endurance, in very
many cases it is known to be practiced for the purpose
of promoting dreams. Beyond this voluntary
fasting there is the enforced fast due to famine or
the scarcity of food.</p>
<p>It will be noticed in many of the cases cited
how much stress is laid on the phenomena of dreams
and how literally they are interpreted.</p>
<p>Among civilized races and those wise in philosophy
dreams play a very important part, and are
classified as monitorial, prophetic, etc., etc. The
habit in modern times of regarding dreams as altogether
fantastic and unreal, is unscientific. In the
mingling of the real and the apparently unreal,
in the dream state, while the experience itself is
always real to the dreamer, lies undoubtedly the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
source of many beliefs that influence the lives of
men.</p>
<p>Dreaming must be regarded as one of the states
of consciousness, and hence, of whatsoever stuff
dreams are made, they represent an actual experience
of the individual. No greater mistake
can be made than the belief that no experience is
real save that which brings us in contact with gross
matter through the agency of the five senses. The
world of ideas and the creations of the imagination
are in fact no more evanescent than matter itself.
Here impermanency differs only in time. All in
time pass away.</p>
<p>I hold that dreams, in general, show more
clearly the nature of the soul, and the experiences
of the waking state show the office of the bodily
organism, and that each <i>on its own plane</i> is as valid
as the other.</p>
<p>In other words, &#8220;the soul is such stuff as dreams
are made of.&#8221; It does not hold true, nor need it,
that the experiences in dreams shall be true and
valid on the physical plane, though this is often the
case, or that the experiences of the physical plane
shall be literally repeated in dreams, which, nevertheless,
frequently happens.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the experiences
of the conscious ego in man compass the subjective
no less than the objective planes of being.
That the subjective avenues should be closed
when the ego is functioning on the physical
plane through the bodily organs by aid of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the senses, is quite as remarkable as that the
physical avenues should be closed when in dreams,
or trance, or syncope, or under anaesthetics, the ego
functions on the subjective planes.</p>
<p>I hold, therefore, that here, more than anywhere
else, is the source of not only belief in the existence
of the soul, but of the relatively uniform conceptions
everywhere attained. The common experience of
man on the one plane is as easily accounted for as
on the other, and individual experience differs no
more widely in the one case than in the other.
So also is the persistence of the human type, or the
<i>genus</i>, involved in the one case no less than in the
other.</p>
<p>All the agencies recognized in modern evolution
tend to elevation only through differentiation, and
even the &#8220;eternal cell&#8221; of Weismann fails in explaining
permanency of form through any physical
transmission. When atavism and degeneracy are
admitted as factors, as they certainly must be, the
perpetuity of the human species fails from physical
causes alone.</p>
<p>I hold the idea of a separable soul to be innate
in the human consciousness, as a necessary deduction
from the experience of the continuity of self-consciousness
which compasses both the objective
and subjective states. This deduction from experience
occurs whenever the evolving ego has
advanced sufficiently above the animal plane to reason
on its own experience, and for this reason the
belief in the separable soul is universal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>It is no more strange that the experience of the
individual should be modified by traditions and the
beliefs of others regarding, for example, the dream
state, than that the experience of the individual
should in like manner be modified or shaped by
traditions and the ceremonies and usages of others
on the physical plane. The bond of unity and that
of diversity have one common root in humanity.
What we need for larger knowledge is, I think,
a recognition of the breadth and sweep of human
experience. To stop either ignoring or quibbling
over one-half of all our actual experience.</p>
<p>The inner world of thought and being is really
the habitat of the soul, while the physical body,
like the diving-bell, enables us to explore and gain
experience on another plane which otherwise must
remain to us forever unknown.</p>
<p>The limitations of space and time are unknown
to us in dreams. These are the limitations of the
fleshly casket. The consciousness of freedom, the
absence of pain and sorrow even under great trial,
are often experienced in the dream state. The
range and character of experience in the subjective
state is modified, and held in check by that of the
physical plane, and the correspondence of an emotion
to an idea, or of an act to a thought, ought to
give us the key to the two sets of experiences and
reveal the underlying basis of equilibrium.</p>
<p>A universal fact and a common experience
argue a universal nature. Like conditions everywhere
come from like causes. These are neither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
accidental nor incidental, nor are they left to the
caprice of savages, nor to that of the more advanced
civilizations.</p>
<p>It is not at all strange that a common experience
should result in a universal belief. The range of
experience and varying vicissitudes of life on the
outer physical plane differ as widely as do those
of the dream plane, and the conscious identity
of the individual is equally preserved on both
planes.</p>
<p>I hold that here lies the origin of belief in the
existence of a soul in man, separable from the body,
and the confines of matter, space, and time, in an
actual experience of every individual. The beating
of the heart, the phenomena of respiration, the
cessation of these at death, and the shadows cast
by man and inanimate bodies serve as connecting
links between the experiences of the individual on
the subjective and objective planes of being.</p>
<p>The dream state and the experiences thence derived
are subjects for psychological science to investigate.
The experiences allotted by du Maurier
to &#8220;Peter Ibbetson&#8221; are not altogether fantastic
and unwarranted, as the records of somnambulism
and hypnotism abundantly prove. When we remember
that nothing deserving the name of Psychology
or Psychic Science exists in the western
world to-day, we need not wonder why men eminent
for investigations in other departments prove themselves
novices and dogmatists here.</p>
<p>The folklore, the traditions, and the mythology
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
of dreams would form a very interesting subject for
discussion. It is true that the literature of the
subject is fantastic, mixed with fable and often
altogether unreliable; but these difficulties offer no
more formidable bar to scientific investigation than
many another problem already classified and formulated
for systematic study.</p>
<p>I know a lady of very superior ability, the mother
of a prominent jurist, who all her life has had
distinct premonitions of many calamities and coming
events, and there are those who dream true in every
community. Fantasies, nightmare, dreams from
indigestion and delirium, form a separate class
where the dreamer is entangled in the meshes of the
bodily functions.</p>
<p>Here fasting, either voluntary or enforced, comes
in, and drugs known to the remotest times are found
to promote and to determine the character of dreams.
There are furthermore processes of mental gymnastics
whereby the thinker withdraws himself from
the bodily avenues of sense and functions at will on
the subjective plane of being.</p>
<p>&#8220;When then,&#8221; said Socrates, in the <i>Phædo</i>, &#8220;does
the soul light on the truth? for when it attempts to
consider anything in conjunction with the body,
it is plain that it is led astray by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And surely,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;the soul reasons best
when none of these things disturb it, neither hearing,
nor sight, nor pain, nor pleasure of any kind,
but it retires as much as possible <i>within itself</i>,
<i>taking leave of the body</i>, and as far as it can, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
communicating or being in contact with it, <i>it aims
at the discovery of that which is</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hold that the most valuable triumphs of
science in the future lie in the realm of psychology,
and that by no means the least important contribution
in this direction will come from the study
of Folklore, of which belief in the separable soul,
and the phenomena and universality of the dream
state must form a very important part.</p>
<p>One final consideration is suggested not without
some degree of hesitation and diffidence. If there
be a soul in man destined to continued existence,
and if in any case perfection is the goal of evolution
as formulated by Herbert Spencer for a future
residue of the human race, then this soul in its
essential elements is without beginning in time.</p>
<p>Pre-existence and evolution necessitate repeated
re-embodiment on the physical plane, and the continuity
of self-consciousness in man I hold to be
the proof of life without beginning or end.</p>
<p>Viewed in this light, dreams and all subjective
experiences in man must mingle reminiscences of
the soul with the experiences of the present life,
and the theory of innate ideas assumes a purely
scientific form. We hence arrive at the intuition
of the soul to account for universal belief. The
experience of Socrates and the Fiji Islander agree
as to the subjective plane as perfectly as in regard
to the beating of the heart. They differ only in
degree of evolution.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>FROM CONFUSION TO CONSTRUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p>A concise and detailed review of the past,
in the long journey of man toward civilization
and independent self-knowledge, has not been
herein attempted. Only hints, here and there, and
the barest outline have been undertaken.</p>
<p>If, however, the intelligent student will follow
these clews, he will find a mass of material and
abundant evidence to corroborate the general thesis.</p>
<p>Every great religion has had its Avatar, its Redeemer,
its <i>Christos</i>.</p>
<p>Each of these religions has adapted from its
predecessors and transformed the old, in whole or
in part, to suit the conditions and apparent needs
of the time.</p>
<p>Each of these revivals of religion has been instituted
on account of the abominations of a dominant
priesthood and the poverty and degradation
of the masses. What was at first claimed and
instituted as a Divine Revelation for the elevation
and happiness of the whole people, has openly and
shamelessly degenerated into enslavement of the
masses and the creation of a despotic and arrogant
class who enslaved both body and soul in the name
of Religion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Priest, Prince, and Potentate generally, united
to terrorize through force, and by superstition and
fear, in order to retain their power.</p>
<p>The reaction has invariably resulted from economic
conditions, as in the case of the Protestant
Reformation, when the gold sent to Rome through
the shameless sale of Indulgences, threatened to
impoverish the whole of Northern Europe, and
Princes broke allegiance to the Priesthood in desperate
self-protection.</p>
<p>Then, and then only, came sufficient protest and
Reformation.</p>
<p>The religionist is apt to regard and designate
Science as &#8220;profane,&#8221; and Religion <i>per se</i>, as
essentially &#8220;holy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing can be really considered &#8220;holy&#8221; that
does not elevate, encourage, and inspire the whole
human race and promote the Brotherhood of Man.
Whenever any religion fails to do this it becomes
indeed a profanation of holy things.</p>
<p>The only religion that ever became the inspiration
of a whole people, so far as history records, was
that of Christna, with the teeming millions of
India. Buddhism was driven out of India by the
powerful and unscrupulous Brahmans, and took
refuge in Ceylon, Thibet, and adjacent provinces.</p>
<p>The religion of Jesus met a similar fate from
the Jews and the Roman governors, until Pagan
Rome adapted and transformed it on the principle
of dominance and exploitation inherent in the genius
of the Latin Race.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>Since which time no one will pretend to claim
that the Religion of Jesus has ever dominated the
human race or any large part of it.</p>
<p>Rome to-day no more represents the religion of
Jesus than the Brahmans of to-day represent that
of Christna, or Buddha, or the religion of the
Vedas.</p>
<p>Nothing is so amazing to-day as that the intelligence
of the present age fails to recognize this
fact.</p>
<p>All of these religions of the past have adapted
their teaching to the multitude through parable and
allegory. Nothing in literature can be found more
beautiful and inspiring, and at the same time comprehensible
to the commonest intelligence, than
Christna&#8217;s &#8220;Parable of the Fisherman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christna and Buddha, like Jesus, taught to their
disciples a &#8220;Secret Doctrine,&#8221; apprehensible only
to the few. &#8220;To you it is given to know the
mysteries,&#8221; but to others, who are without, it is not
given.</p>
<p>It can readily be proven from at least a half
score of the early Church Fathers (see page 70 <i>et
seq.</i> of the author&#8217;s &#8220;Mystic Masonry&#8221;), that the
early church practiced &#8220;Initiation,&#8221; patterned after
those of the Gnostics, Therapeutia and the Mysteries
of Egypt, and divided their neophytes and postulants
into three degrees, as in Blue Lodge Masonry
to-day.</p>
<p>While the great mass of mankind to-day are
incapable of apprehending these genuine mysteries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
of life, and of the individual soul of man, it is
doubtful if any civilization ever existed where so
many were willing and capable of understanding
them as are found here in America to-day.</p>
<p>The reason for this and the growth of intelligence
have already been outlined.</p>
<p>A new race is slowly forming here, designated by
the ancient Wisdom as the &#8220;Fifth Race,&#8221; and
called the <i>Manasic</i>, the growth of Intelligence, or
&#8220;Mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is above all things important that with this
development of <i>Mind</i> there should also develop that
of <i>Buddhi</i>, or Loving Kindness, the essential element
in the Universal Brotherhood of Man; a
thing largely overlooked in the modern theory of
Evolution, and ignored, or set at naught by Romanism
by its dogmas, anathemas, and persecutions.
Instead of the brotherhood of man, she has exhibited
the cruelty and rapacity of devils. (Establishment
of Roman Catholic Caste.)</p>
<p>This all-around development of the whole man,
as essential to human evolution, is everywhere insisted
upon by all the great Masters of antiquity,
and is illustrated and exemplified in the genuine
Greater Mysteries.</p>
<p>Hence, the saying in Kabala, &#8220;The wicked
<i>obey</i> the law through <i>fear</i>; the wise <i>keep</i> the law
through <i>knowledge</i>.&#8221; The Saviors all preached and
practiced the &#8220;Good Law,&#8221; and obedience to legal
mandates.</p>
<p>The explanation usually given of an Avatar by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the ancient Masters, as &#8220;a descent, embodiment, or
incarnation of <i>Vishnu</i>,&#8221; who is not only the &#8220;Preserver,&#8221;
but the &#8220;Rejuvenator&#8221; of mankind, is
rather a <i>blind</i>, and was an interpretation given to
the common people, or the &#8220;profane.&#8221;</p>
<p>All things&mdash;even heaven and earth&mdash;pass away,
and all things are renewed.</p>
<p>This renewal, or regeneration, through the constructive
principle of evolution, is &#8220;designed&#8221; to
be continually on higher and still higher planes.</p>
<p>It is not the range of experience, nor the growth
of intelligence alone, that elevates man, but the
progressive and constructive growth of the soul,
from the physical toward the spiritual plane of
Being.</p>
<p>This actual growth means Knowledge, Wisdom,
Understanding, Knowledge of the Law, Obedience
to its Commands, and Realization of its Rewards.</p>
<p>This Constructive Psychology is the <i>growth of
the Soul</i>.</p>
<p>Man passes, therefore, from the age of Fable,
Superstition, and Fear, to the age of Faith and
Obedience, and finally to that of actual Knowledge.</p>
<p>This <i>age of Knowledge</i>&mdash;not for all of mankind,
but for a larger number who are worthy and well-qualified,
duly and truly prepared than was ever
known at one time before&mdash;has at last dawned.</p>
<p>The question is continually asked, &#8220;Why do the
Masters of Wisdom Conceal their Knowledge?&#8221;</p>
<p>The only adequate answer is that so few are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
ready, willing, and able to receive it in the right
way, and to use and not abuse it.</p>
<p>Those who deny that any such knowledge has
ever existed, or exists to-day, or can exist, had better
waste no time over it. They cannot alter it, nor
destroy it, as their predecessors have tried to do for
ages, often murdering or crucifying all who were
even suspected of possessing it. They might as
well try to destroy the law of gravitation, or
imagine that by murdering the foremost mathematician
of the day that they had destroyed the
science of mathematics. I am speaking of <i>Knowledge</i>
of Spiritual things.</p>
<p>A new Avatar, therefore, is not simply an individual,
though many individuals may understand
and exemplify it&mdash;the Initiated, the Illuminati&mdash;and
one man may lead in representing it.</p>
<p>To call it &#8220;the descent and embodiment, or Incarnation
of Vishnu,&#8221; in a metaphysical sense, the
Spirit (generically), that renews, rejuvenates, transforms,
and regenerates, is by no means an empty
metaphor.</p>
<p>In the same sense we speak of the &#8220;Genius of
Greece,&#8221; or of Rome, or of Civilization.</p>
<p>The <i>idea</i> is composite, and represents an underlying
and <i>universal principle and potency</i>.</p>
<p>But after all metaphor and generalization, each
Avataric movement centered around an individual
<i>Man</i>, and this <i>Man</i> embodied the principle and
undertook the special work of an evangel, or
<i>Christos</i>, or &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; amongst men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Not only have there been many Avatars, and
many Buddhas, but when we realize the meaning
of these terms and the mysteries they represent,
we discover that while it may be the special mission
of one, like Christna, or Buddha, or Jesus, to undertake
the work of enlightening and redeeming any
age; there are other Masters, or Illuminati, engaged
in other work, on different planes, to promote
the same general results.</p>
<p>The result with each of the great Saviors of mankind
has been, that the common people, or the
priesthood, have eventually either crucified or deified
them.</p>
<p>In the case of Jesus they have done both. Eight
separate and deliberate attempts have already been
made to assassinate the present representative of the
School of Natural Science, who was educated in the
order of the Illuminati, and delegated by that
Order to present these great truths to the world
to-day.</p>
<p>This individual is only in the broadest <i>metaphysical</i>
sense (as already defined), an Avatar,
which, as shown, is a <i>composite idea</i>, <i>focused</i> in and
<i>represented by</i> an individual man or teacher.</p>
<p>The work of this Master is to instruct, to exemplify,
and to demonstrate, the ancient Wisdom
on Scientific lines, in keeping with the needs, the
opportunities, and the scientific spirit of the present
age.</p>
<p>He does not preach to the multitude in parables.
He undertakes to instruct the few who are ready
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
and qualified to receive such instruction, and who will
properly use and not abuse it, and he does this
&#8220;without money and without price&#8221;; &#8220;without the
hope of fee or reward.&#8221; (Herein is the Avataric
Spirit of Freemasonry.)</p>
<p>What his reward will be with the rabble, or with
the &#8220;money changers,&#8221; he knows too well, but to
such as he, fear is unknown.</p>
<p>I am speaking not <i>for</i> him, but <i>of</i> him, after the
blessed privilege of seven years of the most intimate
association, and such co-operation as I have been
capable of giving.</p>
<p>His plan and motive seem to be to get as much
as possible of this knowledge of the soul, and of
spiritual things, to the attention of the &#8220;progressive
intelligence of the present age,&#8221; in order that it
may become exemplified and diffused among all
classes, and for the benefit of the whole human
race.</p>
<p>We have passed the age of fable, and of blind
faith, and have come to the age of fact and law.
<i>Kali Yuga</i> means the Iron Age.</p>
<p>As two natures, the physical and spiritual, meet
and mingle in the constitution of man, so do his
faculties, capacities, and powers mingle and function
on the two planes, the physical and the spiritual,
though very largely on the former, with the
great majority in any age or time.</p>
<p>There is implanted in the very foundation of
man&#8217;s being the idea or the consciousness of a
separable soul. It would seem to be an intuition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
for with nearly every people of which we have
any knowledge, no matter how near the animal
plane, the belief or the folklore of a separable soul
exists, in many cases held to be separable during
life, and in most cases believed to survive the death
of the physical body. (See folio editions of Herbert
Spencer&#8217;s &#8220;Descriptive Sociology,&#8221; and Chapter
XIII, herein.)</p>
<p>It has generally been held by scientists and commentators,
that this intuition, or belief, results
largely from dreams.</p>
<p>To say that dreams, in general, are mere fantasies,
or the results of imagination, and have no
real basis in consciousness, is folly; for dreams are
of many kinds, and present great varieties.</p>
<p>They are, moreover, both reminiscent and prophetic,
sometimes moving like any other conscious
experience, from fact to fruition, and in others,
we are unable to relate them to any other conscious
experience.[1]</p>
<p>Hypnosis and Telepathy are related to the same
states, so much so, that the modern scientist has
been constrained to coin two new terms to avoid
endless repetitions, viz.: &#8220;subliminal&#8221; and &#8220;supraliminal&#8221;
states of consciousness.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind all these subjective states and
experiences, including the whole range of so-called
mediumship, the <i>theorem</i> of the Masters and adepts
of all ages may be made exceeding plain.</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: For a very valuable and suggestive treatise on &#8220;Sleep,&#8221; see F. W.
H. Myers &#8220;Human Personality,&#8221; Chap. IV.]
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>It consists in the <i>dominance of the Will</i> over all
conscious states.</p>
<p>This is the <i>Alpha</i> and the <i>Omega</i>&mdash;the principle,
the potency, and the act&mdash;of Mastership.</p>
<p>The mind of the Master no longer drifts in a
boundless sea of fantasy, but with rudder and
compass, he guides his ship whithersoever he would
go.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there are not still degrees
and related states and conditions of consciousness
in his experience.</p>
<p>It does mean, however, that all these states and
conditions, with all his faculties, capacities, and
powers, are <i>co-ordinated</i>, not only in his <i>awareness</i>
of them as a whole, but in the exercise of each and
its relation to the others, dominated by his own
Will.</p>
<p>He has &#8220;Mastered&#8221; them, and can incite or
repress them, while they can no longer dominate
him. Can the reader imagine such a degree of
<i>Self-Control</i>?</p>
<p>This, however, is but the beginning, as the
&#8220;Secret of Power,&#8221; and by no means the end.</p>
<p>Controlling the phases and forms of consciousness,
there comes next the determination to extend their
boundary and to <i>refine and elevate the powers of
the Soul</i>.</p>
<p>In the first case, that of co-ordination, the ancient
Wisdom admonishes the student or <i>chela</i> to &#8220;<i>make
the mind one pointed, like a light burning in a
quiet place</i>.&#8221; Light a candle and put it in a corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
where no draught can reach it, and the flame will
seem as though cut out of solid fire, and &#8220;one
pointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is at the point of refining and elevating the
individual consciousness that Ethics or Morals come
in. It is just at this point also that the <i>Path</i> is
determined.</p>
<p>What our ancient Brothers called &#8220;the power of
Will and Yoga&#8221;&mdash;self-control&mdash;<i>may</i> ignore Ethics.
Here the paths separate, and are called &#8220;the Right-hand
Path&#8221; and &#8220;the Left-hand Path,&#8221; determining
the &#8220;White&#8221; and the &#8220;Black Magician,&#8221;
about whom so much is said in all ancient scriptures
and traditions regarding &#8220;Sorcery&#8221; and &#8220;Black
Magic,&#8221; of which Egypt and Rome and Modern
Mediumship and Hypnotism, are illustrations.</p>
<p>The <i>supreme importance</i> of this natural division
or &#8220;parting of the way&#8221; reveals the real and final
reason why the Masters of the &#8220;right-hand path&#8221;
conceal their knowledge from the profane and reveal
it only after an ethical formulary has been
learned and once for all <i>ingrained</i>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Thugs&#8221; of India are no more an idle
dream nor a bugaboo to frighten children and old
women than are the Mafia and the Roman Jesuit
to-day.</p>
<p>In Egypt the time came when these &#8220;Black
Magicians&#8221; dominated the people and drove out
those of the right-hand path who built the great
pyramid and gave to Egypt the wisdom and glory
of its prime.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>The consciousness and power of these evil men,
however, was limited to the lower planes. Whenever
they wished to transcend these lower planes
they were powerless. Hence arose the <i>Sibyl</i>; young
boys or virgins were hypnotized, and being pure,
they could thus be inducted into a somewhat higher
plane. (See Mabel Collins&#8217; &#8220;Idyll of the White
Lotus.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Margrave, in Bulwer&#8217;s &#8220;Strange Story,&#8221; is a
fine picture of an &#8220;adept of the left-hand path.&#8221;
He would sacrifice the whole human race in order
to gain his personal and selfish ends, just as would
&#8220;Mother Church&#8221; to-day.</p>
<p>The Master of the White Lodge would readily
lay down his life for the benefit of his fellowmen.
Herein is the vital difference.</p>
<p>Here lies the meaning and the complete antithesis
represented by <i>Christos</i> and <i>Satan</i>. Both
names are generic and Avataric, and yet, may be
personified.</p>
<p>This elevating and refining process to which I
have referred is not a matter of sentiment or
emotion, but a matter of fact, with a definite,
scientific formula.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter belief in the existence
AND SEPARABILITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL HAS BEEN SHOWN
to be virtually universal, and in some cases, even
with people of very low development, the belief is
held that the soul may be separated from the body
and reunited again during life.</p>
<p>This is, however, a <i>belief</i>, and proves nothing as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
to <i>fact</i>, <i>science</i>, and <i>law</i>, beyond the existence of the
belief, with all the appurtenances, concomitants, and
subjective experiences of individuals thereunto belonging.</p>
<p>We thus arrive at the real <i>theorem</i> as a cold
psychological problem.</p>
<p>Can the existence and separability of the soul
of man, during his physical embodiment on earth,
and its survival of the death of the physical body,
be scientifically demonstrated as a <i>fact</i>?</p>
<p>If so, then the principles involved, the methods
employed and the whole <i>modus operandi</i> must be
capable of exact, scientific formulation, the same as
any other theorem of science.</p>
<p>Furthermore, granting that this is true, and that
it can be done according to exact formulary, the
value, the effect of such a demonstration upon the
character and the normal faculties, capacities, and
powers of the individual who undertakes and accomplishes
such a demonstration, must be revealed and
taken fully into account.</p>
<p>Does it elevate or degrade him? Is it in line
with normal evolution, and therefore, potentially the
birthright, and finally, through spiritual evolution,
the higher destiny of all men?</p>
<p>Nor is this all. The effect of the existence of
such Knowledge and of its teaching, upon communities,
as a substitute for blind superstition, credulity,
or belief, must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>It may thus be seen how much even beyond the
mere <i>fact</i> of demonstration, is included in this transcendent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
problem; this question of all ages, &#8220;If a
man die, shall he live again?&#8221; or, &#8220;Does the real
man ever die at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it is a demonstrated fact, proven in every
case of a genuine Master, and held inviolable in the
&#8220;Greater Mysteries&#8221; of every age and time, that
the ethical question above raised, as to the effect
upon individuals and society, <i>comes first</i>, and is
made a <i>test</i> of the &#8220;first step&#8221; in the way of demonstration.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the oft repeated quotation,
the candidate for initiation must first be &#8220;worthy
and well-qualified, duly and truly prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>This comprises and constitutes the &#8220;Lesser Mysteries,&#8221;
as in the School of Pythagoras, viz.: the
instruction of the neophyte in ethics or morals.</p>
<p>Nor is this instruction sufficient in any case.
The candidate must himself demonstrate that he has
absorbed, apprehended, and utilized such instruction
by &#8220;<i>Living the Life</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it must have become so ingrained
in his character as to govern absolutely
all his acts and impulses to action, i.e., automatic,
habitual, and natural.</p>
<p>In the School of Natural Science this comprises
and constitutes the &#8220;Ethical Section of the General
Formulary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the School of Pythagoras we are informed
that students sometimes remained for years in the
&#8220;outer court,&#8221; and sometimes they failed entirely
and hopelessly, and went back to the outer world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Whereupon a white stone was erected to their
memory as though they were dead. They were
indeed, for the time being, dead to the School.</p>
<p>This fully answers the ethical question as to the
effect of this real knowledge on the individual and
on mankind.</p>
<p>The real Master sees to it that all that precaution
can provide, or human wisdom can suggest, is done
to insure beneficent <i>use</i> of the knowledge gained.</p>
<p>It is here that &#8220;degrees&#8221; in initiation become a
necessity. Every step, or passage of the candidate
from a lower to a higher degree, is marked and determined
finally and solely by his &#8220;proficiency in the
preceding degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question of Morals, or the ethical effect,
therefore, is pre-determined, and as far as possible,
solved first.</p>
<p>But even with all this wise precaution, the unprepared
and the unqualified have sometimes entered
the outer courts; and when compelled at last to
reveal their character, have turned to rend their
teachers, and have done their utmost to destroy the
School and demoralize mankind.</p>
<p>If these moral renegades could only realize the
<i>meaning to themselves</i> of thus entering the &#8220;Left-hand
Path&#8221; of devolution and of starting voluntarily
&#8220;down the deep descent,&#8221; as portrayed in
Dante&#8217;s &#8220;Inferno,&#8221; or in Ahrinzeman, they would,
indeed, hesitate long before &#8220;turning to the left,&#8221;
for inevitable destruction lies that way.</p>
<p>Here lies the scientific explanation of the &#8220;Fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of Lucifer,&#8221; portrayed in some form in the pantheons
and mythologies of every philosophy and religion
known to man.</p>
<p>The ordinary &#8220;sinner&#8221; may yet possess an &#8220;average&#8221;
of all the virtues, and the ordinary &#8220;saint&#8221;
an &#8220;average&#8221; of all the vices. Concerning these
it was said, &#8220;I would have you either hot or cold,
but because ye are neither hot nor cold, I have
spewed you out of my mouth.&#8221; No lukewarm soul
ever entered the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>But a time at last comes when the soul of man,
enmeshed in the &#8220;lusts of the flesh and the deceitfulness
of riches,&#8221; <i>must make his choice</i>. He <i>realizes</i>
that he can no longer &#8220;serve two masters.&#8221; He
will make his choice knowingly, deliberately, and
voluntarily. Happy and blessed will be he if with
his whole soul, and with every impulse of his being,
he declares, &#8220;I know not what others may do,
<i>but as for me and my house, we will serve the
Lord</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If there are real Masters (and there are), they
have to work under both Natural and Divine Law,
and in strict harmony with the higher evolution of
the whole human race.</p>
<p>It is only a low, feeble, and undeveloped intelligence
that finds God and Nature at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>He who has found &#8220;the place of peace,&#8221; harmonized
his own nature, purified his own life, and
elevated all his desires and aspirations, has discerned
the &#8220;harmony of the morning stars,&#8221; and
caught the symphony of the heavenly hosts. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
other words, he is already functioning on the
Spiritual Plane.</p>
<p>This would seem to make clear the ethical problem
raised, the stress placed upon it, and how it is
met and answered by every genuine Initiate
throughout the ages.</p>
<p>It has to be solved <i>first</i> in each individual case.
Only &#8220;he who <i>lives the life</i> shall know the doctrine,&#8221;
or advance to power.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY AS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN SOUL</h3>
</div>

<p>The writer of the present treatise is quite well
aware that the great majority of intelligent
and educated people at the present day will deny
that any real knowledge of the human soul as a
spiritual entity, separable from the physical body
during life and demonstrably surviving its death,
exists now, has heretofore existed, or, if possible
for man, is likely to exist for some time to come.
Some will unhesitatingly declare such a thing <i>unknowable</i>
for man.</p>
<p>I hold the firm <i>conviction</i> that this knowledge
has been for ages the possession of certain individuals,
few in number in any age or country, and
that this knowledge has resulted through conformity
to certain definite and specific requirements,
formulated under well-known laws of man&#8217;s spiritual
being, involving a definite individual experience
and resulting in a scientific and exact demonstration.</p>
<p>I ask the reader to note two points in the foregoing
statement: First, that for myself I use the
word &#8220;conviction,&#8221; and not &#8220;knowledge&#8221;; and,
second, that the demonstration of real knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
referred to, is made by, and confined to an individual,
in each instance.</p>
<p>With these individuals the knowledge is a <i>scientific
demonstration through personal experience</i>.
With me, the &#8220;firm conviction&#8221; is a matter of
&#8220;circumstantial evidence,&#8221; supported by analogy,
and fortified by empirical testimony, such as acquaint
the world with the facts and findings of
science, and which I think admit of no other consistent
and rational interpretation.</p>
<p>In the foregoing pages I have endeavored to
give outlines, analogies, and suggestions which
seem to fortify the conviction referred to.</p>
<p>While these are fragmentary and desultory,
owing to the fact that the circumstances are so
varied, the subject so vast, and the materials so
abundant, yet, taken as a whole, they seem overwhelming,
and, except to the careful, persistent,
and intelligent student, confusing.</p>
<p>It must be clearly apprehended that no one
familiar with the subject can reasonably suppose,
nor has it ever been claimed by a real Master of the
&#8220;Art,&#8221; that this knowledge ever has been, or can
be, communicated to, or acquired by groups of
individuals at any time, or under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Through all the past, and at the present time, it
is designated as an <i>individual experience</i>.</p>
<p>True, the ethics, and the philosophy, and even
the principles of exact psychic science that in the
past constituted the &#8220;Lesser Mysteries,&#8221; can be,
and often have been, taught to groups, or classes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>In the present &#8220;School of Natural Science,&#8221; this
preparatory training constitutes the &#8220;Ethical Section.&#8221;</p>
<p>But above and beyond all the foregoing general
considerations the &#8220;empirical facts&#8221; and the &#8220;circumstantial
evidence,&#8221; if we know personally one
who claims to have had the specific instruction, the
personal experience, and to have made the scientific
demonstration referred to and outlined in the problem,
our opportunity for instruction, and for the
application of tests for validity and reasonableness
as to the whole problem, is exceedingly valuable.</p>
<p>This personal acquaintance may become the nearest
possible criterion, short of our own personal
experience, as to demonstration.</p>
<p>In previous chapters this phase of the subject
has, perhaps, been sufficiently dwelt upon.</p>
<p>The Master may say, &#8220;I know; I have had the
personal experience; I have demonstrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The student may at last say, &#8220;I believe; I am
convinced; I am satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the foregoing pages the effort has
continually been made to preserve clearly this distinction.</p>
<p>In tracing analogies through the history of the
past, the conditions, premonitory, present, and subsequent
to great world-movements have often been
referred to.</p>
<p>Nothing is more common or more patent than the
oft-repeated saying, &#8220;This is the age of science.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
Any great movement that undertakes at the present
day to deal with the deeper problems of individual
and social life, must fit in and conform to the
&#8220;spirit of the present age.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that platform it must appeal; in that language
it must be addressed, and by such judgment and
criterion must it stand or fall.</p>
<p>All these tests and criteria have been fully met
by the School of Natural Science, and they are
clearly outlined and set forth in the &#8220;Great Work,&#8221;
addressed to &#8220;the Progressive Intelligence of the
Age.&#8221;</p>
<p>There need be no misconception or misinterpretation
at this point.</p>
<p>It is true that superficial thinkers and readers,
enthusiasts and emotionalists, are likely to infer that
the science of the soul can now be had &#8220;for a consideration&#8221;
and in &#8220;a dozen easy lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>All such are doomed to disappointment.</p>
<p>It is furthermore likely, if the average &#8220;physical
scientist&#8221; pays any heed at all, that he will devise
a series of &#8220;tests&#8221; and &#8220;experiments&#8221; of his own,
to fit his preconceived notion of things psychical,
with the latent conviction, at least, that he will be
able to prove the whole thing a humbug.</p>
<p>These, also, are doomed to disappointment.
Physical tests of psychical and spiritual laws and
processes are unscientific. No spiritual problem
can be solved in terms of physical matter alone.</p>
<p>So-called psychological science to-day is in the
condition of one possessing a fine piece of ground,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and gathering materials for a house, a superstructure.</p>
<p>The ground is already covered with bricks and
stones, and sand and lumber, piled in every direction,
with the purpose of one day beginning the
work of construction, and the slogan, &#8220;Wait! Not
yet!&#8221; &#8220;Some day we are hoping to build.&#8221;</p>
<p>No architect, &#8220;no designs on the trestle-board,&#8221;
and so they go on accumulating &#8220;facts&#8221; and
&#8220;evidence&#8221; day after day, year after year, century
after century.</p>
<p>They have a &#8220;working hypothesis,&#8221; but no
definite <i>theorem</i>, and they may work till doomsday
on this line without a glimmer of real scientific
knowledge of the human soul, yet with mountains
of &#8220;facts&#8221; or of &#8220;rubbish.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can never prove the existence of a <i>spiritual
entity</i> in terms of matter on the physical plane.</p>
<p>Their work has been, and still is, of great interest
and value, but it is in no scientific sense, <i>Constructive</i>,
backed by the laws of proportion and
harmony, nor the &#8220;Canon of Architecture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The apotheosis of Natural Science is like the
&#8220;canon of proportion&#8221; in architecture, introduced
by Vitruvius (an Initiate) centuries ago. It is
the verification of Plato&#8217;s saying, &#8220;God geometrizes,&#8221;
and his concept of &#8220;the World of Divine
Ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plato further declares, &#8220;He who knows not the
common things of life is a brute among men. He
who knows the common things of life is a man among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
brutes. But he who knows all that can be learned
by diligent inquiry is a god among men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natural Science, as shown in the Great Work,
includes scientific knowledge on all planes of being
on which the soul of man functions: The physical,
moral, psychical, and spiritual; for man is a composite
being.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of Natural Science, therefore,
is Fact, Law, Demonstration, and Knowledge; before
theory, conjecture, creed, dogma, superstition,
or fear, intuition, inspiration, revelation, and &#8220;holy
men&#8221; or &#8220;holy books&#8221; that must be accepted without
evidence, or &#8220;believed&#8221; against evidence.</p>
<p>The <i>Avatars</i> of all the past have originated great
reformations which have at last degenerated into
dogma and superstition.</p>
<p>The people, incapable of understanding the Law,
have been taught in parables, while the few in all
religions and in every age have apprehended the
law and learned the &#8220;Secret Doctrine.&#8221;</p>
<p>To-day, for the first time in centuries, for the
reasons already assigned, and in keeping with the
scientific spirit of the age, and because superstition
in power, dogma, and persecution are politically
dethroned, these great truths, this Great Work, is
openly declared and outlined so that he who wills
may apprehend.</p>
<p>Let no one say, &#8220;This is an effort to <i>deify</i>
an individual.&#8221; It <i>is</i> an effort to enthrone Truth;
to remove the barriers to the rights of conscience,
the shackles of reason, private judgment and Individual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Responsibility, and to free the soul of
man from all the fetters of ignorance, superstition,
and fear, in order that he may be &#8220;first a man,&#8221;
&#8220;then a Master,&#8221; and at length on a higher plane
of being, something more than man has yet realized,
or ever dreamed.</p>
<p>Something &#8220;that eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, nor hath it yet entered into the heart of
man to conceive the glory that shall be revealed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The beginning is here and now, when man shall
achieve the Mastery of Self and really possess his
own soul, and not hold it tremblingly as a <i>pawn</i> of
some pretentious potentate of the soul.</p>
<p>The right of Light, Knowledge, and further
progress by &#8220;<i>Being a Man</i>,&#8221; and not a chattel, an
asset, a pawn, or a slave.</p>
<p>This is the coming <i>Avatar</i>, and the dawn is already
here.</p>
<p>Will the day darken, the Light be quenched?
Who can tell?</p>
<p>The redemption of Woman from the slavery of
all the past is well under way, and it is indeed a
glorious sign.</p>
<p>No lesson in history is plainer nor more readily
demonstrated than the fact that the degeneracy of
a religion and the degradation of woman go hand
in hand.</p>
<p>Demonstrate to-day in any country on earth the
status of woman as a whole, and no mistake need
be made as to the prevailing religion.</p>
<p>Woman&#8217;s political disability is another matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
entirely; for she is dominated by man only because,
and only so far as, she is handicapped or degraded
by the dominant religion.</p>
<p>Take woman from the churches, Protestant or
Romish, to-day, and no church could do business
for a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>For these reasons the immense and rapidly growing
movements, Women&#8217;s Clubs and the like, to-day,
are of great significance, backed and illuminated
as they are by all past history.</p>
<p>In the new movement, the School of Natural
Science, the door is as wide open to woman as
to man. I might paraphrase the slogan of the
Robber Barons of the middle ages. &#8220;<i>She</i> may
seize who hath the power, <i>She</i> may hold who
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the coming Illuminati woman will stand by
the side of man in all opportunity, endeavor, or
achievement.</p>
<p>In the new age woman will be something few
men have even yet dreamed of.</p>
<p>We might call this new age &#8220;<i>the Woman&#8217;s
Avatar</i>,&#8221; without doing violence to either religion,
tradition, history, or science; while the sacred
Hymns of the Vedas, with the angel of the household
and the inspirer of the soul of man, the worship
of Divinity, by both men and women, opened
a new heaven on this old earth.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;such children as will be born, without
pain, not through chance, caprice, nor under
protest, but even as they were in Greece, as an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
offering of Love on the altar of divine man-womanhood,
with a song of joy to heaven.</p>
<p>Prof. Fiske somewhere said, &#8220;The evolution of
man by Natural Selection draws near its close, to
be followed by that of Divine Selection.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Divinity <i>in</i> man is <i>Christos</i>, the &#8220;son of the
Father,&#8221; the Divine and Eternal <i>Avatar</i>.</p>
<p>Belief is rather a superficial process, the intellect
(&#8220;mortal mind&#8221;) mingled with the emotions,
changing and evanescent. &#8220;Now you see it, and
now you don&#8217;t.&#8221; It is mingled with hope that
alternates with fear and doubt.</p>
<p>Faith, when once analyzed and apprehended, is
another thing entirely, though nearly every one,
and most writers, confuse &#8220;belief&#8221; and &#8220;faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith is the soul&#8217;s <i>intuitive conviction</i> of that
which both <i>Reason</i> and <i>Conscience</i> approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genuine faith rarely wavers or changes, because
it is an evolution, a &#8220;growth of the soul,&#8221; a
spiritual experience, and it becomes the &#8220;dominant
chord&#8221; in the symphony of life, determining
Harmony.</p>
<p>It is in this deliberate and discriminative sense
that I have used the term <i>conviction</i> in relation
to the Master and his &#8220;Great Work.&#8221; He never
dogmatizes, nor undertakes to &#8220;indoctrinate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In answer to a question on some deep and perplexing
problem of the soul or of the spiritual
plane, he replies, &#8220;So far as we <i>know</i>, it is so and
so.&#8221; &#8220;A new experience, or an added light, may
alter our conclusion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>The average individual scarcely realizes what
absolute sincerity, with no motive save Love of
Truth, and beneficence to man guided by clear intelligence,
and dominated by the rational Will,
means, or can accomplish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE NEW AVATAR</h3>
</div>

<p>From all the foregoing general considerations
it may be discerned that the &#8220;New
Avatar&#8221; is strictly that of <i>Scientific Demonstration</i>.</p>
<p>As we use terms in vogue at the present day,
it pertains to the field of Natural Science.</p>
<p>This does not imply that it is irreligious, nor
unreligious, nor sacrilegious.</p>
<p>When it is clearly apprehended it will be found
to be the only thing that harmonizes&mdash;not the Institutions
of man&mdash;but Science, Philosophy, and
Religion <i>per se</i>, as departments in human intelligence.</p>
<p>Man will thus discern &#8220;the rational order that
pervades the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The purpose and result of such knowledge to
man are Harmony, Enlightenment, Courage, and
Hope.</p>
<p>Man <i>is</i> the arbiter of his own destiny. He may
<i>become</i> the Master of his own Fate. Such are the
<i>Illuminati</i>, the &#8220;Masters of the Great White
Lodge,&#8221; the Benefactors of the whole human
race, the members of the &#8220;School of Natural
Science.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>What would I have my readers do? I answer,
<i>Investigate</i>! Study! Think! Wait! Hope! Anticipate!</p>
<p>Careful, intelligent, and conscientious investigation
will determine the fact that we possess in
America to-day <i>one</i> who can fill all the requirements
that I have endeavored to designate and
portray&mdash;not as a &#8220;reincarnation&#8221; of Buddha or
Jesus, but as a &#8220;Master&#8221;&mdash;one who has been duly
instructed and prepared, who has had the personal
experience, and has made a <i>practical demonstration</i>,
that determines Mastership.</p>
<p>He has demonstrated that &#8220;there is no death,&#8221;
but transition only (except through conscious and
determined devolution, or <i>suicide of the soul</i>).
Man is, after all, and in the last analysis, a &#8220;free
moral agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a Member of the &#8220;Great School&#8221; he was
educated and initiated many years ago, and has
consecrated his life to this service. He has demonstrated
the separability of the soul by leaving and
returning to his body at will.</p>
<p>The School of Natural Science; the Great Work;
the Individual Representative; the conditions of
the present age; the opportunities offered; the demand
for real knowledge everywhere; the falling
in pieces of creeds and dogmas; the expectancy so
often voiced&mdash;all of these correspond intimately
with what the ancient Aryans designated as
&#8220;<i>Avataric</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not now the deification of any Individual,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
but the &#8220;<i>apotheosis of Natural Science</i>,&#8221; as the
foundation and method in the achievement of actual
knowledge.</p>
<p>From this actual knowledge will arise a new
Faith, not a new religion, but the old Religion of
Humanity, precisely as taught and lived by Jesus,
Christna, Buddha, and all the other &#8220;Redeemers,&#8221;
and real Avatars of the past.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Enemy of all Righteousness,&#8221; as already
said, have made many attempts to assassinate this
Representative of the Great School, but he goes
steadily about his own work. These enemies realize
the danger to their unholy work, but not the <i>Power</i>
back of this great movement. This they can never
destroy.</p>
<p>The day of enlightenment has come, and the cry
has gone forth, Ho! all ye who are heavy-laden,
involved in fear and doubt and uncertainty; bewildered,
discouraged, despairing, and committing
suicide! There is no death! Man is the Arbiter
of his own Fate! Look up and Live, and Hope
and <i>Realize</i>!</p>
<p>And there shall dawn for you a new heaven and
a new earth in which dwelleth Love and Peace and
Righteousness; with Jesus&mdash;the <i>Christos</i>&mdash;your
&#8220;elder Brother,&#8221; leading the way, and the downtrodden,
the poor and despised children of men,
shouting Hosanna! for the Loving Kindness that
will have taken the place of selfishness, strife,
cruelty, superstition, and Dogma.</p>
<p>Religion will no longer be a matter of mere sentiment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
nor of emotion, of blind belief, nor of fear,
superstition, dogma, nor creed&mdash;but a <i>Great Work</i>.
So Mote it be.</p>
<p>The author of this volume can lay no claim for
it as a systematic treatise on Psychology, either
according to the rules of composition or the orderly
sequence of science.</p>
<p>It is rather a number of essays, some of which were
written without reference to publication, or the
design, at the time, of putting them together in a
single volume.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, more or less repetition, the
same subject under a different title, viewed from a
different aspect, yet involving the same principles,
motives, and aims.</p>
<p>But the subject of Psychology is so vast, so
intricate, so interesting and important, and yet, in
the average mind, so confused, and so little known,
that considerations from many sides, and even
repetitions in the application of a given principle
in various ways, are believed more likely to make
the whole subject apprehensible to the general
reader to whom it is addressed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the author believes that the time has
come when Psychology, as a <i>Constructive Science</i>
of the nature, laws, and destiny of the Human Soul,
need no longer be regarded as unknown or unattainable,
but open to all who seek it in the right way,
giving to it the consideration, time, and loyalty it
so amply deserves.</p>
<p>To such as these, it is hoped, the foregoing pages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
may give many clews and sidelights, suggestions,
encouragement, and hope.</p>
<p>Psychology, to the Author of this volume, means
literally <i>A Knowledge of the Human Soul</i>, rather
than of treatises upon the subject, or of the opinions,
beliefs, or dogmas of men.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
</div>

<p>The oligarchy of creeds, and the autocrats of
Rome no more represent the &#8220;Coming of the
Son of Man,&#8221; the Divine Logos that was and is &#8220;in
the bosom of the Father in heaven,&#8221; than do the
Rockefellers, the Morgans and the Harrimans, constituting
the oligarchy of wealth, or than the political
grafters and bosses of our municipalities represent
the &#8220;New Commandment,&#8221; &#8220;that ye love
one another.&#8221; The barons of wealth have not yet
resorted directly to murder, as has Rome for ages.</p>
<p>St. Augustine says, &#8220;What is now called the
Christian religion existed among the ancients and
was not absent from the human race until Christ
came, from which time, the true Religion, which
existed already, began to be called &#8216;Christian.&#8217;&#8221;
(See Heckethorne&#8217;s &#8220;Secret Societies,&#8221; page 12,
Introduction.)</p>
<p>As to the basis of scientific chronology regarding
the Wisdom of the Masters, and their
indestructible records, I quote the following from
a modern student of Astrology. His method of
reckoning is correct, even though his dates may not
be absolutely exact, as he is not a &#8220;Master.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>CHRONOLOGY AND THE &#8220;RIDDLE OF
THE SPHINX.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ancient religious symbols bear a striking resemblance
to the constellations of the heavens,
especially those of the Zodiac, and if this be their
true meaning, we have an infallible key to their
chronology. At the beginning of the Christian
Era, the constellation Aries, or Ram, occupied the
equinoctial place, being in the first degree of that
constellation. About 2150 B.C. the first degree of
Taurus, or Bull, contained the Equinox. When
the constellation Taurus, or the Bull, was in the
first division, or the equinoctial place, the people
used a symbol representing a bull, described as
giving fecundity, a deity of vegetation as at Dodona,
in their religious ceremonies. One of the statuettes
found recently in the excavations of Crete, was a
woman figured between bulls and lions, with a
dove or eagle on her head, and holding serpents in
her hand. This figure would seem to represent
mother earth between the constellations Taurus,
Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. She is figured between
Taurus (the Bull) on one side, Leo (the
Lion) at her feet, Aquila (or Eagle) in the constellation,
Aquarius on her head, and Scorpio (or
the Serpent) in her hand; all forming the sacred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
cross or &#8216;Swastika,&#8217; with the constellations Taurus
in the vernal Equinox; Leo beneath the earth, the
Eagle or Aquarius overhead, and Scorpio held in
her hand toward the west.</p>
<p>Archæologists place the date in which this symbol
was in use in Crete at 1100 to 1500 B.C. These
dates are included between 2150 B.C. and the year
1 A.D. By the same method we are enabled to
calculate the age of the Sphinx.</p>
<p>This Sphinx apparently represents the constellations
Leo (the Lion) and Virgo (the Virgin). It
has a lion&#8217;s body, and a woman&#8217;s head and breast.
When the Sphinx was built, it seems the spring
equinox occupied a point between these two constellations,
and as the spring, or Easter, festivals
of the ancients were held on or about March 21st
of our calendar, this Sphinx was the representation
of Leo and Virgo, the point in which the Sun
crossed the equator, or equinoctial line.</p>
<p>Now as the equinox retrogrades from east to
west in the reverse order of the constellations, as
well as the reverse order of the movement of the
planets, the Sun will not cross the equator at the
same point each year, but at a point a little to
the west, amounting to about fifty and a third
seconds of arc. At this rate the equinox will pass
backward through the constellations, making a complete
revolution in a little less than twenty-six
thousand years, or at the rate of about twenty-one
hundred and fifty years to a constellation of thirty
degrees. Now by taking the present position of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the equinox in the constellation Pisces, we find that
it has nearly reached the constellation Aquarius.
About 1909 years ago it was in the first point of
Aries. If we begin at its present point in Pisces,
and count back to the Junction of Leo-Virgo, we
will have to count 1909 years to first point of Aries;
2150 years to the first point of Taurus; 2150 years
to Camini; 2150 years to Cancer; 2150 years to
Leo and 2150 years to the constellation Virgo.
This indicates that the Sphinx was built 12,659
years ago, or approximately 10,750 B.C. (John
Kilduff.)</p>

<p>As a work of art this romance is one of
great power and original conception.</p>
<p>No other works of this great author have
provoked such diversity of criticism as
&#8220;<i>Zanoni</i>.&#8221; To some, this book represents a
temporary aberration of genius without
definite purpose. To others it represents surpassing,
bold and original speculation, profound
analysis of character and thrilling
interest; but <i>to the one who knows</i>, every
character in this book is recognized by a
familiar sign and symbol which, though hidden,
is nevertheless patent to the initiated.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/ad09.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 119px; height: 160px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>This is another of those marvelous books
by <i>Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton</i>. &#8220;A Strange
Story&#8221; is the antithesis of &#8220;Zanoni.&#8221; It is a
most absorbingly interesting story depicting
the destructive psychic practices and possibilities
against which &#8220;<i>The Great Psychological
Crime</i>&#8221; so timely warns the human
race.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, both &#8220;A Strange
Story&#8221; and &#8220;Zanoni&#8221; are carefully veiled
exposes of the two oldest and most powerful
centers of Spiritual knowledge extant, and
are revelations of the loftiest pursuits and
the most malign practices known to human
Intelligence.</p>
